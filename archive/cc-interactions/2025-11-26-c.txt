> /compact QA Pilot Completion and Protocol Documentation

  Project: TRAP Attribution Extraction QA
  Session: Continuation of QA pilot, focusing on documentation and terminology standardisation

  ## Work Completed This Session

  1. **Verified pilot completion status**
     - 16 records verified (5 Team A, 11 Team B including 2 missing records added)
     - 270 records in attribution.csv (was 268)
     - All 10 QA issues resolved and corrections applied

  2. **Wrote comprehensive QA Protocol** (`docs/qa-guidance.md`)
     - 5-phase workflow: Pre-QA Setup → Per-Record Verification → Cross-Record Checks → Documentation Outputs → Summary Statistics
     - Templates for comparison tables, QA issues, source coverage matrix
     - Checklists for per-record and per-record-set requirements
     - Red flags and systematic checks

  3. **Terminology standardisation: "PDF" → "DPF scan"**
     - Updated all references in `docs/qa-guidance.md`
     - Updated all references in `docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md`
     - "DPF scan" = Daily Progress Form scan (scanned PDF of handwritten daily summary forms)

  4. **Column rename: `Summary_Author` → `DPF_Author`**
     - Updated `outputs/attribution.csv` header
     - Updated all documentation references

  5. **Added Value Discrepancy Resolution table** (`docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md`)
     - DPF scan and diary agreed (CSV wrong): 2/7
     - DPF scan preferred over diary: 5/7
     - Diary preferred over DPF scan: 0/7
     - Total: 7/7

  6. **Created pre-correction snapshot** for Gemini comparison
     - `archive/snapshots/attribution-2025-11-26-pre-qa-pilot.csv`
     - 267 records, original schema (single `Author` column)
     - Created `archive/snapshots/README.md` with naming convention

  ## Key Files Modified
  - `docs/qa-guidance.md` — Now 440+ lines with complete QA protocol
  - `docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md` — Updated terminology, added resolution table
  - `outputs/attribution.csv` — Column renamed
  - `outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2010-autumn.md` — Status marked COMPLETE

  ## Uncommitted Changes
  - All QA corrections to attribution.csv (unit fixes, missing records, walker dedup, schema changes)
  - All documentation updates
  - Snapshot files

  ## Ready For
  - Git commit of all changes
  - Gemini comparison using pre-correction snapshot
  - Scaling QA methodology to remaining ~254 records

> great, thank you! can we now look at extending our QA assessment to other seasons, aiming for full coverage? We could continue 
manually for a couple more team/seasons, or we could take our experience and attempt to automate the review, while keeping work in 
small enough chunks to maintain quality and comprehensiveness (I am very pleased with how the pilot QA went and want to maintain or 
improve it) 

● Great question! Let me first understand the full scope - what we have to cover and what sources are available.

● Excellent question. Let me analyse what we're working with:

  Scope Summary

  | Season          | Records | Teams                                 | QA Status  |
  |-----------------|---------|---------------------------------------|------------|

  | KAZ 2011 Autumn | 66      | A (17), B (17), C (18), D (14)        | Pending    |

  Total: 270 records, 16 verified (6%), 254 remaining

  Source Availability by Season

  | Season          | DPF Scans           | Diaries          | QA Confidence       |
  |-----------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|
  | ELH 2010 Autumn | ✓ Day_XX.pdf        | ✓ EN             | High (both sources) |
  | KAZ 2009-2011   | ✓ X_YYYYSummary.pdf | ✓ BG (most) + EN | High (both sources) |
  | ELH 2009 Autumn | ✗ None found        | ✓ EN             | Lower (diary only)  |

  Options

  Option A: Continue Manual QA (2-3 more batches)

  Candidates (small, good sources):
  - KAZ 2010 Team A — 9 records, consolidated PDF, BG+EN diaries
  - KAZ 2011 Team D — 14 records, BG diary only (tests transliteration)
  - ELH 2009 Team A — 22 records, diary-only (tests no-DPF workflow)

  Pros: Refine methodology, discover more patterns, high quality
  Cons: Slow (~16 records took substantial effort)

  Option B: Semi-Automated with Batch Review

  Process one team/season at a time:
  1. I follow the QA protocol systematically
  2. Produce comparison tables and issue lists
  3. You review each batch before corrections apply
  4. Iterate until patterns are stable

  Pros: Faster while maintaining review checkpoints
  Cons: May miss nuances; requires discipline in prompt structure

  Option C: Hybrid Approach

  1. Manual pilot one more season with different characteristics (e.g., KAZ 2009 with BG diaries + consolidated PDFs)
  2. Codify differences between Elhovo vs Kazanlak workflows
  3. Then semi-automate remaining seasons with batch review

  Which approach appeals to you? Or would you like me to propose a specific sequence?

> let's do at least one more season manually to catch more issues, perhaps one with poorer documentation than the one you chose 
before 

● Good thinking. The obvious candidate is Elhovo 2009 Autumn — it has no DPF scans at all, forcing us to develop a diary-only
  verification workflow.

  Proposed: Elhovo 2009 Autumn

  | Property  | Value                                 |
  |-----------|---------------------------------------|
  | Records   | 62 (A=22, B=20, C=20)                 |
  | DPF scans | ✗ None                                |
  | Diaries   | ✓ EN primary + BG secondary for B & C |
  | Challenge | Single-source verification only       |

  Why this is valuable

  1. Tests source gap handling — How do we document confidence when we can't cross-verify?
  2. Diary-only workflow — Different protocol than the pilot
  3. Same study area as pilot (Elhovo) — Can compare patterns
  4. BG/EN diary pairs for Teams B & C — Can cross-check within diaries

  Suggested approach

  Start with Team B (20 records):
  - Has both DiaryTeamB.doc (EN, PRIMARY) and TeamB_Dnevnik (Ross).doc (BG, SECONDARY)
  - Can cross-reference EN vs BG versions even without DPF scans
  - Manageable size

  Then do Team A (22 records) which has only EN diary — tests the truly minimal-source scenario.

  Shall I begin with Elhovo 2009 Team B? I'll:
  1. Locate and read the source documents
  2. Extract the 20 CSV records for this team
  3. Systematically verify each against the diary sources
  4. Document findings in a new runsheet, noting the diary-only limitations

> Yes, please proceed as you did previously; recall that you can always consult previous conversations under archive/cc-interactions/
 if you need to refresh your memory of what we did

  So confirmed: no DPF scans for daily verification. The PDFs are individual survey unit forms, not daily summaries.

       245 +  **Type:** CSV field missing (extraction error)
       246 +  
       247 +  | Source | Value |
       248 +  |--------|-------|
       249 +  | EN Diary (DiaryTeamB.doc) | Start: 71063, End: 71142 |
       250 +  | BG Diary (TeamB_Dnevnik Ross.doc) | Start: 71063, End: 71142 |
       251 +  | CSV (current) | Start: (empty), End: (empty) |
       252 +  
       253 +  **Resolution:** Add Start Unit 71063, End Unit 71142
       254 +  
       255 +  **Reasoning:** Both EN and BG diaries agree on unit numbers. Unit continuity confirms: 71063 follows Nov 3 end unit 
           + (71062) + 1.

       259 +  ### D014: Erroneous QA_Notes — Incorrect Diary Coverage Statement
       260 +  
       261 +  **Type:** Metadata error
       262 +  
       263 +  **Affected records:** 2009-11-02 B, 2009-11-03 B, 2009-11-05 B
       264 +  
       265 +  **Current QA_Notes contain:**
       266 +  > "No autumn survey season: No autumn 2009 survey season - diaries end in March/April"
       267 +  
       268 +  **Resolution:** Remove this erroneous note
       269 +  
       270 +  **Reasoning:** The DiaryTeamB.doc covers 10 October 2009 through 21 November 2009 with detailed daily entries. The 
           + statement is factually incorrect and caused the extraction errors documented in D011-D013.

       275 +

       282 +  | BG Diaries | ✓ Present for Teams B and C |
       283 +  
       284 +  **Notes:** No Daily Progress Form scans exist for Elhovo 2009 Autumn. All 62 records (Teams A, B, C) rely on 
           + diary-only verification. This limits cross-verification confidence but does not affect data completeness where 
           + diaries are thorough (as with Team B).

       361    ## Notes

● QA Complete: Elhovo 2009 Autumn — Team B

  20 records verified against both EN and BG diaries (no DPF scans exist for this season).

  Key Findings

  | Category                    | Count | Details                                              |
  |-----------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------|
  | MAJOR: Missing unit numbers | 3     | Nov 2, 3, 5 — diary has data, CSV empty              |
  | Metadata error              | 1     | Erroneous "no autumn diary" note (affects 3 records) |
  | Minor: Unmapped name        | 1     | "Lizzy" — already flagged in name-mapping.csv        |
  | Confirmed records           | 17    | All other records match diary                        |

  Root Cause

  The original extraction incorrectly assumed the Team B diary ended in spring 2009, resulting in:
  - 3 records with empty unit numbers (data was available)
  - Erroneous QA_Notes stating "No autumn 2009 survey season - diaries end in March/April"

  The diary actually covers 10 October through 21 November 2009 with complete daily entries.

  Unit Continuity

  Perfect — all 20 records have continuous unit sequences. The diary-provided values for Nov 2/3/5 fit exactly into the gaps.

  Output Files

  - Runsheet: outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2009-autumn-b.md
  - Discrepancies log: Updated with D011-D014, S004

  Pending Your Approval

  3 corrections to add unit numbers:
  - 2009-11-02: 70926–70962
  - 2009-11-03: 70963–71062
  - 2009-11-05: 71063–71142

  Plus removal of erroneous QA_Notes.

  Shall I apply these corrections? Or would you like to review the runsheet first?

> I've reviewed the runsheet and approved / provided feedback. Can you please also update the source-inventory if needed to ensure 
that the extant diaries are listed there? Make sure that all diaries are listed and are designated primary vs. secondary based on 
which is larger / newer / best curated / most thorough (may require manually reading the diary) 

● I'll apply the approved corrections and then review/update the source inventory for Elhovo 2009 diaries.
