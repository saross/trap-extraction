● The source inventory has been created at outputs/source-inventory.md. It
  contains:

  - Tier 1: 7 Excel SurveySummary files
  - Tier 2: 40+ diary files (organised by season/team, noting language)
  - Tier 3: Scanned PDF daily progress forms

  The file also includes priority rules for extraction and a checklist of
  sources not yet fully processed (Elhovo diaries, Kaz 2011 student
  journals, role data).

  Ready for the next task when you are.

> A few files are missing from the inventory, can you check the transcripts 
of our conversations in archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-21-b.txt and 
2025-11-21-c.txt and add any missing files you find there? I provided you 
comprehensive lists for Kaz 2009 and Kaz 2010

● The inventory looks comprehensive. I see the lint warnings are about
  duplicate headings (same season names in Tier 2 and Tier 3). Let me fix
  those and verify nothing's missing:

● Fixed the duplicate heading lint warnings. Checking the transcripts, the
  inventory appears complete:

  Kaz 2009 (from transcript b):
  - 5 team diaries (A-E, BG and EN where available) - all listed
  - 9 PDF summary files - all listed

  Kaz 2010 (from transcript c):
  - 8 team diaries (Teams A-D, BG and EN) - all listed
  - 4 PDF summary files - all listed

  Is there a specific file you noticed missing? The inventory includes all
  files referenced in the extraction work.

> ah, yes, I see the one I thought was missing, my apologies. For 
completeness, please also add:\
\
/media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-202

0-04/Elhovo 2010-12-12/2009/Project Records/Team C/TeamC_Dnevnik.doc\
\
Please add these to the appropriate section. \
\
Finally, I'd like you to produce a list of expected-but-missing files, e.g.,
 we expect that each season will have an Excell SurveySummary file (Tier 1),
 and that each team for each season will have:\
\
- A diary in at least one language (Tier 2)\
- Scans of daily survey record sheets (Tier 3)\
\
If I know what's missing I can do ask others if it exists and do more 
exhaustive searches, perhaps in backups, etc.

       194    ## Sources Not Yet Processed
       195    
       196    The following sources exist but have not been fully 
             extracted:

● Done. Added the two BG diaries and created a "Missing Files" section.

  Summary of expected but missing:

  Tier 2 (Diaries):
  - KAZ 2009 Team E - no EN version
  - KAZ 2011 Teams A & D - no EN versions

  Tier 3 (PDF Scans):
  - ELH 2009 Teams A, B, C - no PDFs found
  - KAZ 2011 Teams A & D - no PDFs found

  The missing EN diaries for Bulgarian teams may never have existed (teams
  with only Bulgarian speakers). The missing PDFs are worth searching for in
   backups.

> Great - can you add thi 'expected but missing' section to the 
source-inventory.md doc so that it's persistent? 

● It's already there! I added it in the previous edit - see lines 166-190 of
   source-inventory.md. The section "Expected but Missing Files" with the
  three tables (Tier 1, Tier 2 missing EN versions, Tier 3 missing PDFs) is
  now part of the document.

> ah, sorry, thanks, too much multitasking here. What's next on our list? I 
think that I'd like you to systematically go through the Tier 2 diaries that
 you haven't already (Kaz 2011, Elhovo/Yambol 2009-2010) and incorporate any
 relevant informaiton into final_attribution_v2_cleaned_edited.csv and 
name-mapping-draft.csv. Does that seem logical? 

● Yes, that's logical. Let me set up the task list:

● Unprocessed Tier 2 diaries:

  1. Kaz 2011 - Teams A, B, C, D (6 diary files)
  2. Elhovo 2009 - Teams A, B, C (6 diary files including the BG ones you
  just added)
  3. Elhovo 2010 - Teams A, B + GC-RS diaries (7 files)

  I'll start with Kaz 2011. Should I proceed?


> Yes. Please also confirm that you've gone through *all* the Kaz 2009 diaries, there's a long list and we may have missed some before.
  Perhaps add a tick box to source-inventory.md to confirm that each source has been completed. Oh, that reminds me! we determined
  previously that while you extracted walker names from Kaz 2009 and Kaz 2010, you *didn't* extract other roles, such as 'PDA operator',
  etc., that are listed in the final attribution spreadsheet. So, back up for a minute and make a plan to comprehensively review all the
  Tier B diaries for (a) walker names, (b) identified roles. If other roles are reported, you may add addition columns (as you did for
  'Author'). This is a lengthy task, so let's make a proper plan. Divide it into phases as necessary. Ask any clarifying questions you 
have. 
                                                                                                                                       
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Which roles should I extract from diaries? Current columns are PDA_Operator, Paper_Recorder, Data_Editor, Author. The diaries 
     mention PDA, GPS, Forms, Pics. Should GPS map to a new column or existing one? → Add multiple new columns
     · For seasons already partially extracted (Kaz 2009, Kaz 2010), should I re-read all diaries to capture roles, or only extract 
     roles from diaries not yet read? → Re-read all diaries

  Todos
  ☐ Extract Kaz 2011 team diaries (A, B, C, D)
  ☐ Extract Elhovo 2009 diaries (Teams A, B, C)
  ☐ Extract Elhovo/Yambol 2010 diaries
  ☐ Update name-mapping-draft.csv with new names

● The Kaz 2011 diaries have some role mentions embedded in narrative but not structured like Kaz 2010. I found:
  - 03 Nov: "Hamish was taking the pictures", "Joel was working with pda"
  - 05 Nov: "Bethan doing paper records, Hamish action shots, Cecelia GPS and tracklog"

  Let me check Elhovo 2010 which may have more structured data:

● Excellent! Elhovo 2010 Team B has rich role data with initials (DR=PDA, KL=GPS, etc.). This is valuable but needs mapping initials to
  names.

  Let me check our progress and summarise findings so far:

  Role data availability by season:
