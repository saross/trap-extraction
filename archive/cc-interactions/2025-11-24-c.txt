● Great! I found PDFs for Team B and Team E. Let me start with Team E's missing March/April dates, then Team B.

  Team E missing dates:
  - 2009-03-27: E_20090327.pdf ✓
  - 2009-03-31: Check E_Summary26Mar-3Apr.pdf
  - 2009-04-03: E_20090403.pdf ✓

  Team B missing March dates:
  - 2009-03-03: Check B_Summary04Mar-08Mar.pdf or B_2009Summary.pdf
  - 2009-03-27: Check B_Summary25Mar-05Apr.pdf
  - 2009-04-05: B_20090405.pdf ✓

  Let me start with Team E's specific date PDFs:

● Read(/media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-2020-04/Kazanluk/2009/Project
      Records/TeamE/E_20090327.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (1.8MB)

● This PDF contains intensive survey forms (individual unit cards) rather than Daily Progress Forms with Start/End Unit fields. Let
  me check the Team E summary PDF instead, which should have the consolidated unit ranges:

      Records/TeamE/E_Summary26Mar-3Apr.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (111KB)

● Excellent! I can see Team E Daily Progress Forms. Let me extract the data:

  Page 1 shows:
  1. 2009-03-26: Start Unit: 50247, End Unit: 50289 (already have this from diary)
  2. 2009-03-31 (shown as "April 0"): Start Unit: 50520, End Unit: 50542 ✓
  3. 2009-03-27: Start Unit: 50290, End Unit: 50319 ✓

  Now let me check for 2009-04-03:

      Records/TeamE/E_20090403.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (937.4KB)

● Perfect! I found Team E data in the first summary PDF. The second PDF is individual intensive survey unit cards, not Daily
  Progress Forms. From the E_Summary26Mar-3Apr.pdf I can see:

  Team E extractions:
  - 2009-03-27: Start Unit 50290, End Unit 50319 ✓
  - 2009-03-31: Start Unit 50520, End Unit 50542 ✓

  For 2009-04-03, the E_20090403.pdf shows individual unit cards but no Daily Progress Form with a consolidated range. Let me update
   the CSV with what I've found and then check Team B.
