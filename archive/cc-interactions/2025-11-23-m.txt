  Task: Investigate 2011-11-29 Team B Record Origin

  Initial Problem:
  - Record exists in Kaz11_SurveySummary.xlsx but had NO diary entry in either 
English or Bulgarian diaries
  - Diaries end Nov 25; this record is Nov 29 (4 days later)
  - Previous session incorrectly flagged as "DIARY COVERAGE GAP"

  Investigation Findings:
  ✅ VALID SURVEY DAY - Confirmed by Adela Sobotkova (team leader that day)
  - Small, final area survey: 2 hours (09:00-11:00), 13 units (22600-22613)
  - Scanned survey forms exist: B_20111129.pdf
  - Not documented in diaries (project wind-down phase - photography/packing)
  - 7-day field walking hiatus for Team B (last field day was Nov 22)

  Walker Identification (from scanned form initials: P, P, A, B):
  - ✅ A = Adela Sobotkova (leader)
  - ✅ P = Petra Janouchová
  - ❓ P = Likely Petra Tušlová
  - ❓ B = Likely Bethan Donnelly or Bara Weissová

  Files Modified

  outputs/attribution.csv:

  1. Line 265 (2011-11-22 Team B): Added missing walkers (Hamish | Petra) from 
Bulgarian diary
    - Source: B_2011Diary_BG.docx
  2. Line 269 (2011-11-29 Team B): Updated with walker data
    - Walkers_Name: Adela | Petra Janouchová | [P-unknown] | [B-unknown]
    - Walkers_Alias: Adela | Petra | [P] | [B]
    - Source: B_20111129.pdf
    - QA_Notes: Changed from "DIARY COVERAGE GAP" to "Incomplete - 2 walkers 
need positive identification from scanned
  forms"
    - Detailed extraction notes documenting confirmation by AS

  Data Quality Impact

  - Resolved mystery record (confirmed as legitimate survey day)
  - Walker data coverage: 204/268 records (76.1%) - no change
  - 2 walkers still need positive identification from scanned forms or 
handwriting comparison

  Next Steps (Optional)

  - Examine B_20111129.pdf scanned forms to identify remaining 2 walkers (second
 P and B)
  - Check if full names or more detailed initials visible in scanned forms
  - Cross-reference with other late November Team B forms for handwriting 
patterns

> Hi CC, I'd like to see what's wrong with reading the B_2011Diary_En.docx. 
The 22 November entry is pasted below, I'm not
  sure why you were having trouble reading it.\
\
Date: 22 Nov 2011, Tuesday, freezing foggy, in the afternoon sunny
Leader: Adela
Members: Hamish, Petra
The goal of the day was to cover rest of the middle peninsula, where team B 
was operating 20 Nov and proceed to the W peninsula, where team B failed to 
finished complete the whole area because of mud (12 Nov). One mound should 
be recorded again (3276).
During the day 4 sites were found (2 of them were recorded earlier and 
scatter from those sites was confirmed and closely investigated – such as 
site 1015, DUN 008). Strategy of survey was mainly intensive (spanning from 
10 to 20 m, only with few exceptions: 22527-30 ATS, 22523-4 Extensive, 
22532-4 3 m distances, prehistoric site and steep slope.)
First site scatter was recorded in units 22512-15, situated under the steep 
slope with preistoric BA site, registered in 2009 as number 1015. Pottery 
was handmade, red and black with inclusions, fragmented (3) and heavily worn
 (4). Some pieces of daub were also found (22513). Concentration of pottery 
was 3 per m2 in the centre of 22513. Pottery was situated on the steep 
slope, falling down from the top to the water level (next to site 1015).
Due to the difficult terrain in polygons 22527-22530 the ATS was chosen as 
the best strategy to cover the area (slope more than 60%, river stream and 
bushes everywhere), no finds at all.
En route onto the DS peninsula ( after crossing the stream) an occasional 
piece of pottery was noticed trodden into the flat dirt road. GPS point 023 
(unit 11049) marks a spot where a large piece of pithos was found in situ, 
picture taken (no. 0591), confirmation of site from prevoius seasons (2009, 
DS 008).
2204 Roman scatter
RM, MA; Hab; xxx msl; xx ha/ xx ha

As the team proceeded towards the southern tip of peninsula to survey beyond
 the southen boudnary of the 2009 survey extent, a scatter was noted in the 
red gravelly soil on the flat plateau among the sparse burs. It was marked 
TRAP No. 2204 and fell in previously (12 Nov) made polygon 22222 and 22225, 
with radius of some 50m. A sample was taken (pic. 0592), density of scatter 
was 5 frgs/m2, mainly ancient AC and RM pottery, and some diagnostic pottery
 (rims, bottoms). PDA point 2204, GPS point 024 was taken on the little 
embankment of the W peninsula over the dry part of Koprinka. Density was 5 
frgs/m2 in the middle.
Chronology: Roman and later Ancient pottery
Function: hard to determine, fine tablewares, pithoi and AC indicate some 
permanent structure, possibly a small farmstead or villa
2205 Prehistoric scatter 
EBA?,LBA, EIA, RM; Hab; xxx msl; xx ha/ xx ha

A scatter dominated by prehistoric handmade pottery was discovered on the SE
 facing steep slope at the DS peninsula, some 2.7km NW of the location of 
Seuthopolis. The slope was some 45 %, covered with bands of gravel deposited
 and eroded by the waters of the reservoir. The visibility was relatively 
high 60% in comparison to other previously submered areas, which had been 
silted over. Here the drop of the water level had washed out the fine silt 
and bared shards of pottery, eroding more from the slope. The recovery of 
these shards was made difficult by the steep and  slippery scree-filled 
slope as well as the relative unobtrusiveness of the handmade sherds.
The densest part of the scatter was embedded in ca 100m of gravel lines 
running parallel of the top of the slope, the lower edge being too steep to 
make its examination viable. The scatter was less visible towards the West 
on the plateau due to the silt.
The diagnostic pieces in the scatter pottery spanned from the Bronze Age to 
Early Iron Age. The debris included thickwalled handmade pottery, lithic and
 daub. The fragments were relatively large (frag = 2) and the wear was 2 and
 contained lot of decorated diagnostic sherds. One sherd with Pshenichevo 
stamp was found as well. 
Two total pick ups were collected in this scatter: 511 was 10x10 and further
 north 512 5x10m, and 513 5x10m; yielding xx kgs of pottery and xx sherds 
and diagnostics.
Chronology: Majority of the scatter yielded sherds from Early Bronze Age to 
Early Iron Age. Towards the north the scatter merged with the 2204 Roman and
 later material. 
Function: sedentary habitation site – construction and storage material 
suggests a considerable settlement 

2206 Thracian scatter
EIA, LIA; Rit,Mor; xxx msl; xx ha/ xx ha

A single period scatter was located on the very tip of the DS peninsula 
facing SE, some 200 m south from the prehistoric site 2205 and just East and
 South around the mound 3276. The mound was situated on the SE part of the W
 peninsula (3rd one), usually situated under water. Large density of pottery
 was found, the site has extent cca 200 m2, all in the steep slope running 
even under the level of water. Visibility on the site is under 50% because 
of huge concentration of small to large stones, stoniness 4. Passability is 
4 caused by steep slope. Pottery is mixed up, no obvious horizontal 
stratigraphy was found. Mixed with animal teeth (goat, sheep). Large grey 
ware such as dolium like thracian pot (frag 3, wear 1), grey pithos (frg. 
1-3), large red CW (AC or pithos, frg. 3, wear 5). Burns HM pieces (frgs. 
3-4, wear 4). Two small fragments of red slip were found (frgs. 5, wear 4) 
during the writing diary entry. GW is decorated, diagnostic fragments 
collected, hellenistic red fine ware with few inclusions. Mostly 15 frgs/m2.
 The rest was left on the spot for further TP, which is strongly 
recommended. Interpretation of the site: possibly could be feasting or 
ritual spot; lot of consumption ware, such as cups, canthars, and HM ware 
found there. Reveals similarities with site 2031. Maybe ritual pits???
Mound 3276 – the site is situated on its slope. 2 RT on the top of the 
mound, covered with large stones, 2 pics taken. One RT on the W, second on 
the E, both max 1 m deep, 2-3 m wide. GPS point 025 was taken on the top. 
Mound could be possibly excavated by Getov, but the trenches seems to be 
later.

● You're absolutely right - that entry is clearly there and very detailed!
  Let me investigate what went wrong with my file extraction.

● Ah, I see the problem now! Looking at the system reminder at the top - I
  attempted to extract the full English diary to /tmp/team_b_2011_full.txt
  but that file only ended up with 1 line. The extraction to the temp file
  clearly failed.

  When I then searched that incomplete temp file for the Nov 22 entry, it
  wasn't there (because the file was essentially empty), so I fell back to
  using the Bulgarian diary.

  Just now when I ran the extraction command directly with unzip -p ... | 
  sed | grep, it worked perfectly and found the Nov 22 entry immediately.
  The entry shows:

  Date: 22 Nov 2011, Tuesday, freezing foggy, in the afternoon sunny
  Leader: Adela
  Members: Hamish, Petra

  This matches exactly what the Bulgarian diary had:
  Водач:Адела Екип:Хамиш,Петра
  (Leader: Adela, Team: Hamish, Petra)

  Root cause: The command to extract the full diary to a temp file failed
  (likely an issue with the sed pattern or output redirection), creating a
  1-line file. When I searched that broken temp file for "22 Nov", it
  returned nothing, leading me to incorrectly conclude the English diary
  didn't have that entry.

  Why it worked just now: Instead of extracting to a temp file first, I
  piped directly from unzip → sed → grep, which succeeded.

  My apologies - I should have tried the direct extraction pattern when the
  temp file approach failed, rather than assuming the English diary didn't
  have the entry. You were absolutely right that the English diary is the
  primary source and it's much more detailed than the Bulgarian one.

> ok, not sure if the information that day helps, but I'm happy we found the
 root cause. We need to put it on a to-do list to figure out whether the 'B'
 stands for Bethany or Bara, but I've got something else to ask you first:\
\
I think in the attribution CSV that we're not being consistent whether the 
team leader is listed as a walker. I'd like to standardise on the approach 
that the team leader *is* also, always listed as a walker for the day 

● Good catch on the inconsistency! Let me create a todo list for both tasks,
   then work on standardizing the leader-as-walker approach.

   listed as a walker. Let me verify this is accurate by checking a few

● Excellent! The standardisation is complete. The script updated 139 out of 
  268 records (52%), ensuring that team leaders are now consistently
  included in the walker lists across all records.

● Summary

  Task: Standardise leader inclusion in walker lists

  Result: Successfully updated 139 of 268 records (52%)

  Changes:
  - Leaders are now consistently included at the start of both
  Walkers_Original and Walkers_Transliterated columns
  - Created backup:
  attribution.csv.backup_leader_standardisation_20251123_215645
  - Updated records span all survey seasons (2009-2011)

  Examples of updates:
  - 2009-03-03 Team B: Added 'Adela' to walker list
  - 2010-11-02 Team B: Added 'Dr. Ross' to walker list
  - 2011-11-29 Team B: Added 'AS' to walker list

  The data is now consistent with your preferred approach that team leaders
  are also always counted as walkers for the day. The remaining task on the
  todo list is to identify whether 'B' on 2011-11-29 is Bethan Donnelly or
  Bara Weissová.

> ok, let's call the second 'B' 'Bethan Donnelly'

> what is next on our list of to-dos? 

● Done! Updated 2011-11-29 Team B to identify B as Bethan Donnelly.

● All current tasks are completed! Here's the summary:

  ✅ Standardised leader inclusion - Updated 139/268 records so team leaders
   are always listed as walkers
  ✅ Identified Bethan Donnelly - Updated 2011-11-29 Team B record

  Remaining items:
  - 2011-11-29 Team B still has one unidentified walker: second 'P' (likely
  Petra Tušlová but not confirmed)

  I notice you have failed-extractions-resolution-report.md open in your
  IDE. Would you like to work on resolving failed extractions, or is there
  something else you'd like to tackle?

> First, I confirm the 'P' as Petra Tuslova. Then, yes, let's work on 
resolving any remaining failed extractions

> ok, I need to set up a GitHub repo for the work we've done here and sync 
it - in the past, I've always created the online repo first, then cloned 
locally - can you walk me through the process of moving the local repo to 
GitHub? 

● I'll walk you through pushing your existing local repository to GitHub.
  The process is straightforward!

  Step-by-Step Guide

  Step 1: Create the GitHub Repository (You Do This)

  1. Go to https://github.com/new
  2. Choose a repository name (e.g., trap-extraction or
  kazanluk-attribution)
  3. Important: Do NOT initialise with README, .gitignore, or licence (since
   you already have commits)
  4. Click "Create repository"
  5. GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions - keep this open

  Step 2: Add GitHub as Remote and Push (I'll Help)

  Once you've created the empty GitHub repo, give me the repository URL (it
  will look like https://github.com/username/repo-name.git or
  git@github.com:username/repo-name.git) and I'll:

  1. Add it as the remote origin
  2. Push your existing commits
  3. Set up branch tracking

  Quick Reference Commands (For When You Have the URL)

  # Add GitHub as remote
  git remote add origin <your-github-url>

  # Push all commits and set upstream
  git push -u origin master

  # Verify remote is set
  git remote -v

  Question for you: Have you created the GitHub repository yet, or would you
   like me to wait while you do that? Once created, just paste the
  repository URL here and I'll execute the commands to sync everything up.

  Note: If you prefer SSH over HTTPS, make sure you have SSH keys set up
  with GitHub first. Otherwise, HTTPS will prompt for your GitHub username
  and token.

  Remaining Untracked Files

  I notice there are some untracked files. The git repository root is at
  TRAP-WD-2020-04/ level, which contains both claude_extraction/ and several
   sibling directories.

  Currently untracked:

  1. Sibling directories (outside claude_extraction/):
    - DataExtractionWork/
    - Elhovo 2010-12-12/
    - FinalData/
    - Kazanluk/
    - Shared GIS/
    - TRAP-2017-2018/
  2. Archive content (inside claude_extraction/):
    - archive/README.md
    - archive/cc-interactions/ (15 session transcripts from this week)
    - archive/diary-extraction/
    - archive/name-disambiguation/
    - archive/project-summaries/
    - archive/supersession-project/

  Recommended Next Steps

  Option A: Keep repository focused on claude_extraction only (Recommended)
  - Add sibling directories to .gitignore (they appear to be source data)
  - Add the archive content within claude_extraction/
  - This keeps the GitHub repo focused on the extraction work only

  Option B: Track everything
  - Add all directories to git
  - GitHub repo becomes the full TRAP working directory

  Which approach would you prefer? I can execute either option for you.

> I'd like it focused on claude_extraction only, without any other 
directories included. That was my error, I only meant to include the 
extraction work in the repo! 

● I'll fix this by creating a .gitignore to exclude those sibling
  directories, then add the remaining claude_extraction archive content.

● ✅ Repository Now Focused on claude_extraction/ Only!

  What I Did

  1. Created .gitignore to exclude source data directories:
  /DataExtractionWork/
  /Elhovo 2010-12-12/
  /FinalData/
  /Kazanluk/
  /Shared GIS/
  /TRAP-2017-2018/
  Plus Python venv, cache, IDE, and OS files.

  2. Added remaining archive content:
  - Archive README and subdirectories
  - 15+ Claude Code session transcripts (cc-interactions)
  - Diary extraction documentation and plans
  - Name disambiguation reports
  - Intermediate data files
  - Project summaries

  3. Committed and pushed to GitHub:
  - Commit 477258b with 51 files, 22,074 insertions
  - Successfully pushed to git@github.com:saross/trap-extraction.git

  Repository Now Contains

  Only claude_extraction/ work:
  - ✅ Main attribution.csv (100% walker coverage)
  - ✅ All 6 extraction/quality scripts
  - ✅ Complete archive of reports, backups, and session transcripts
  - ✅ Source inventory and follow-up actions
  - ✅ README and documentation

  Excluded (via .gitignore):
  - ❌ Source data directories (Kazanluk/, FinalData/, etc.)
  - ❌ Python virtual environment
  - ❌ IDE and OS files

  Repository Status

  Current branch: master
  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'
  Working tree: clean

  The repository is now clean, focused, and fully synced to GitHub! You can
  view it at https://github.com/saross/trap-extraction

> ok, we won't do this now, but I think I made an error - I need to move the
 'claude_extraction' folder to a new location and remove it from this drive,
 I had intended to initialise git in that folder, but looking at this 
process, I see I made a mistake and accidentally initialised git in the 
parent 'trap-wd-2020-04' folder. Can you suggest the pathway for rectifying 
this? please write it to a 'repo-migration.md' plan.

     # Repository Migration Plan: claude_extraction to Standalone Repository
     **Date:** 23 November 2025
     **Issue:** Git repository accidentally initialised in parent directory 
     (TRAP-WD-2020-04) instead of claude_extraction/ subdirectory
     **Goal:** Migrate claude_extraction/ to new location as standalone

● ✅ Migration Plan Created

  I've written a comprehensive migration plan to repo-migration.md that
  covers how to fix the git initialization issue.

  What the Plan Includes

  Three migration options:

  1. Option A: git-filter-repo (Recommended)
    - Fastest and cleanest
    - Preserves complete commit history
    - Requires installing git-filter-repo tool
    - ~15-30 minutes
  2. Option B: git subtree split
    - No installation required (built-in Git)
    - Preserves complete commit history
    - Slower than Option A
    - ~30-45 minutes
  3. Option C: Fresh start
    - Simplest approach
    - Creates single commit with all current work
    - Loses individual commit history (but preserves it in archive docs)
    - ~10-15 minutes

  Key Features of the Plan

  - ✅ Step-by-step instructions for each option
  - ✅ Verification checklist
  - ✅ Backup strategy before starting
  - ✅ Risk mitigation steps
  - ✅ Pre-migration questions to answer
  - ✅ Post-migration actions
  - ✅ Support commands for dry-runs and verification

  Result After Migration

  /path/to/new/location/trap-extraction/    ← Git repo root (correct!)
  ├── .git/
  ├── archive/
  ├── inputs/
  ├── outputs/
  ├── scripts/
  └── README.md

  The claude_extraction/ wrapper directory will be removed, making the
  repository structure match its GitHub URL and allowing easy relocation.

  When you're ready to execute: Just follow the plan in repo-migration.md. I
   recommend Option A if you can install git-filter-repo, otherwise Option
  B.

> ok, we'll do that tomorrow. In the meantime, can you please make a plan to
 fully update documentation of claude_extraction, updating all readmes and 
other documentation? 

● I'll research the current documentation state and create a comprehensive
  plan for updating all documentation.

     # Documentation Update Plan for claude_extraction
     **Date:** 23 November 2025
     **Status:** Ready to execute
     **Context:** Project complete - 100% walker data coverage achieved
     ---
     ## User Preferences (from Q&A)
     … +294 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Done! I've saved the complete documentation update plan to
  documentation-update-plan.md.

  The plan includes:
  - All 6 phases of updates
  - User preferences from the Q&A (archive obsolete files, public repo,
  create 4 new docs)
  - Consistent statistics to use throughout
  - Pre-commit checklist
  - Estimated 2-hour completion time

  What are the quick things you'd like me to do before we compact?

> Ok, the quick thing is that I'd like you to make a to-do list of the final
 actions needed to get our attribution CSV finished for submission to the 
AKB:\
- fill in the missing survey unit numbers\
- ensure we have team leader for every day\
- update all names to standardised names (first ensuring that the 
name-mapping document - which I think was erroneously moved to archive/ - is
 complete)\
- make every effort to extract as much role information as possible (pda 
operator, paper records person, etc.), by means of a *thorough* NLP 
exampination of the diaries (systematically employing primary diaries, then 
supplemental diaries, then secondary diaries to make sure we've extracted 
*all* available information relating to walker roles)\
- plan and complete a QA exercise covering accuracy and completeness\
- package outputs and source materials for a secondary QA conducted by 
another LLM (Gemini 3)\
\
Do not undertake any of these tasks yet, just add them to a markdown to-do 
list, creating one if necessary. Please do let me know if I'm missing any 
actions that you believe we need to take.\
\
The second (hopefully) quick thing to add is that I'd like to aim to make 
the documentation FAIR4RS compliant, in the next session the first thing I 
need to do is ask for the plan to be reviewed and modified to achieve this 
goal.\
\
Finally, please create a /compact message so we can begin again smoothly.

     … +354 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(claude_extraction/documentation-update-plan.md)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines

● Perfect! I've created akb-submission-todo.md with all your requested tasks
   plus 4 additional recommendations:

  Your requested tasks:
  1. ✅ Fill in missing survey unit numbers (18 records)
  2. ✅ Ensure team leader for every day
  3. ✅ Standardise all names (noted that name-mapping.csv is in archive/)
  4. ✅ Extract role information via thorough NLP diary analysis (tiered
  approach)
  5. ✅ Plan and complete QA exercise
  6. ✅ Package for Gemini 3 secondary QA

  My suggested additions:
  7. Create data dictionary (formal column documentation)
  8. Verify participant name spelling against TRAP-Participants.csv
  9. Review and finalise Extraction_Notes
  10. Create submission metadata for AKB

  Each task includes approach, status, and priority level.

  Note on FAIR4RS compliance: I'll add this to the
  documentation-update-plan.md notes for next session review.

  /compact Message

  Session 2025-11-23-l Summary

  Context: 182k→101k tokens | Project completion phase

  Major Achievements:

  1. Confirmed Walker Identifications (2011-11-29 Team B)
    - Petra Tušlová confirmed as second 'P'
    - Bethan Donnelly confirmed as 'B'
    - Record now complete: AS | Adela | Petra Janouchová | Petra Tušlová |
  Bethan Donnelly
  2. Resolved All Failed Extractions
    - 100% walker data coverage achieved (268/268 records)
    - Removed 11 stale "MISSING: Walkers" flags
    - QA flagged records reduced from 32 to 21 (remaining flags are about
  survey units, not walker data)
  3. Repository Setup and Organization
    - Successfully pushed to GitHub:
  git@github.com:saross/trap-extraction.git
    - Created .gitignore to focus repo on claude_extraction/ only
    - Organized outputs/: moved 26 files to archive/ subdirectories
        - 17 backups → archive/outputs/backups/
      - 5 extraction reports → archive/reports/extraction/
      - 2 final reports → archive/reports/final/
      - 2 docs → archive/outputs/documentation/
    - Active outputs/ now contains only: attribution.csv,
  follow-up-actions.md, source-inventory.md
  4. Documentation Created
    - repo-migration.md - Plan to fix git root location (move from
  TRAP-WD-2020-04/ to claude_extraction/)
    - documentation-update-plan.md - Comprehensive 6-phase plan for updating
   all docs
    - akb-submission-todo.md - 10-task plan for final AKB submission
  preparation

  Key Files Modified:
  - outputs/attribution.csv - Final walker identifications, 100% coverage
  - Created 3 planning documents for future work

  Repository Structure (Post-Cleanup):
  claude_extraction/
  ├── outputs/
  │   ├── attribution.csv (MAIN OUTPUT - 100% complete)
  │   ├── follow-up-actions.md
  │   └── source-inventory.md

  └── [documentation files]

  Pending Work (Documented, Not Started):

  1. Repo Migration (repo-migration.md)
    - Fix git root (currently TRAP-WD-2020-04, should be claude_extraction/)
    - Use Option A (git-filter-repo) recommended
    - Relocate to new drive location
  2. Documentation Update (documentation-update-plan.md)
    - 6-phase comprehensive update

    - Standardise all names via name-mapping.csv
    - Extract role data via thorough NLP analysis
    - Complete QA exercise
    - Package for Gemini 3 secondary QA
    - Create data dictionary and submission metadata

  Statistics:
  - Records: 268/268 (100% walker coverage) ✅
  - GitHub: git@github.com:saross/trap-extraction.git ✅
  - Commits pushed: 3 (main achievement + cleanup + archive)
  - Active outputs/ files: 4 (cleaned up)

  Next Session Priorities:
  1. Review documentation-update-plan.md for FAIR4RS compliance
  2. Execute documentation updates
  3. Begin AKB submission preparation tasks

> have I run an /export since the last compact event? 

● No, you have not run /export since the last compact event.

  Sequence:
  1. You ran /export earlier → saved to
  archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-23-l.txt
  2. I provided the /compact message just now

  So the current session content after the compact message has not been
  exported yet. If you want to preserve this session's work (the AKB todo
  list, documentation plan notes, and compact summary), you should run
  /export now.
