● QA Pilot Complete: Elhovo 2010 Autumn

  The pilot QA verification is now complete. Here's a summary of what was
  accomplished:

  Records Verified

  - 16 total records (5 Team A + 11 Team B)
  - 2 missing records discovered and added (7 Nov, 10 Nov Team B)
  - CSV now contains 270 records (was 268)

  Issues Found & Corrected

  | Severity | Count | Description                                        |
  |----------|-------|----------------------------------------------------|
  | MAJOR    | 5     | 3 unit errors (#6-8), 2 missing records (#9-10)    |
  | Minor    | 5     | Walker duplicates (#1-5, 77 records de-duplicated) |

  Key Outcomes

  1. Schema improvement: Split Author into Diary_Author and Summary_Author
  2. Unit continuity: Now perfect across all Team B records
  3. Source priority validated: PDF PRIMARY for basic info, Diaries PRIMARY
  for roles
  4. Documentation complete:
    - outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2010-autumn.md — Full verification findings
    - docs/qa-guidance.md — Methodology with rules, heuristics, observations
    - docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md — All discrepancies with resolutions

  Methodology Validated

  The pilot successfully established:
  - Source priority hierarchy (PDF > Diary for basic info)
  - Error severity classification (MAJOR vs minor)
  - Unit continuity cross-checking (Rule C1)
  - Source gap tracking protocol

  This methodology is now ready to scale to the remaining 254 unverified
  records when needed.

> ok, great! Can we please write up a protocol for everything that needs to 
be recorded when perform QA on a group of records? If needed, please consult
 our previous conversation in full at 
archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-26-a.txt. This can go into the 
qa-guidance.md file if it is not already there. Our goal is to make this QA 
operation consistent and repeatable. 

● I'll consult the archived conversation and the current guidance document
  to create a comprehensive, repeatable QA protocol.

       140 +  ## QA Protocol: Complete Workflow
       141    
       142 -  ### Per-Record Verification Workflow
       142 +  This section documents the full QA process for verifying a 
           + group of attribution records. Follow this protocol to ensure
           +  consistent, repeatable verification.
       143    
       144 -  ```text
       145 -  1. EXTRACT record from attribution.csv
       146 -  2. LOCATE corresponding PDF daily form
       147 -     - Read/transcribe walker names, units, date, form author
       148 -  3. LOCATE corresponding diary entry
       149 -     - Read walker list, roles, any notes
       150 -  4. COMPARE CSV fields against sources
       151 -  5. APPLY RULE CHECKS (R1, R2)
       152 -  6. APPLY HEURISTICS if disambiguation needed (H1, H2)
       153 -  7. LOG discrepancies with reasoning
       154 -  8. FLAG issues requiring user review
       144 +  ### Phase 1: Pre-QA Setup
       145 +  
       146 +  Before beginning verification:
       147 +  
       148 +  1. **Identify records to verify**
       149 +     - Filter attribution.csv by study area, season, and/or 
           + team
       150 +     - Note total record count and date range
       151 +  
       152 +  2. **Locate source documents**
       153 +     - PDF Daily Progress Forms (check `Field Records/` 
           + directories)
       154 +     - Primary diary (check `Project Records/Team X/` 
           + directories)
       155 +     - Secondary diary (if applicable — older versions or 
           + alternate team diaries)
       156 +  
       157 +  3. **Create source inventory table**
       158 +  
       159 +     ```markdown
       160 +     | Type | File | Location | Dates Covered |
       161 +     |------|------|----------|---------------|
       162 +     | Diary | [filename] | [path] | [dates] |
       163 +     | PDF | [filename] | [path] | [dates] |
       164 +     ```
       165 +  
       166 +  4. **Note PDF-to-date mapping**
       167 +     - Day_XX.pdf files may contain multiple forms for 
           + different dates
       168 +     - Record which forms appear in which PDF files
       169 +  
       170 +  ### Phase 2: Per-Record Verification
       171 +  
       172 +  For each record in the target set:
       173 +  
       174 +  #### Step 2.1: Extract CSV Record
       175 +  
       176 +  Pull the current CSV values for all fields:
       177 +  
       178 +  - Date, Team, Start Unit, End Unit
       179 +  - Leader, Walkers_Original, Walkers_Standardised
       180 +  - PDA_Operator, Paper_Recorder, GPS_Operator, Photographer
       181 +  - Diary_Author, Summary_Author
       182 +  - XLS_Source, PDF_Source
       183 +  - Extraction_Notes, QA_Notes
       184 +  
       185 +  #### Step 2.2: Locate PDF Daily Form
       186 +  
       187 +  1. Find the corresponding PDF form for the date
       188 +  2. Extract from PDF:
       189 +     - Date (verify match)
       190 +     - Team designation
       191 +     - Start Unit, End Unit
       192 +     - Leader name
       193 +     - Walker names/initials
       194 +     - Form Author (→ Summary_Author)
       195 +  3. **Record PDF availability:** Present / Missing
       196 +  
       197 +  #### Step 2.3: Locate Diary Entry
       198 +  
       199 +  1. Find the corresponding diary entry for the date
       200 +  2. Extract from diary:
       201 +     - Date (verify match)
       202 +     - Walker count and names
       203 +     - Role assignments (PDA, GPS, Paper Records, etc.)
       204 +     - Leader
       205 +     - Diary Author
       206 +  3. **If primary diary entry missing:** Check secondary 
           + diary
       207 +  4. **Record diary availability:** Present / Missing / 
           + Secondary Used
       208 +  
       209 +  #### Step 2.4: Compare Fields
       210 +  
       211 +  Create a comparison table for each record:
       212 +  
       213 +  ```markdown
       214 +  | Field | CSV Value | PDF Value | Diary Value | Status |
       215 +  |-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
       216 +  | Date | | | | CONFIRMED / DISCREPANCY |
       217 +  | Team | | | | CONFIRMED / DISCREPANCY |
       218 +  | Start Unit | | | | CONFIRMED / DISCREPANCY / SOURCE GAP |
       219 +  | End Unit | | | | CONFIRMED / DISCREPANCY / SOURCE GAP |
       220 +  | Leader | | | | CONFIRMED / DISCREPANCY |
       221 +  | Walker count | | | | CONFIRMED / DISCREPANCY |
       222 +  | Walkers | | | | CONFIRMED / PARTIAL / DISCREPANCY |
       223 +  | Roles | | | | CONFIRMED / SOURCE GAP |
       224    ```
       225    
       226 +  Status values:
       227 +  
       228 +  - **CONFIRMED** — CSV matches source(s)
       229 +  - **DISCREPANCY** — CSV differs from source(s)
       230 +  - **SOURCE GAP** — Source unavailable for this field
       231 +  - **PARTIAL** — Some values match, others differ
       232 +  
       233 +  #### Step 2.5: Apply Rule Checks
       234 +  
       235 +  For each record, verify:
       236 +  
       237 +  - [ ] **R1:** All role holders appear in Walkers list
       238 +  - [ ] **R2:** Leader appears in Walkers list
       239 +  - [ ] **C1:** Start Unit follows previous day's End Unit 
           + (±1)
       240 +  
       241 +  Document any rule violations.
       242 +  
       243 +  #### Step 2.6: Apply Heuristics (If Needed)
       244 +  
       245 +  Use heuristics for disambiguation:
       246 +  
       247 +  - **H1 (Team stability):** Check nearby days if name 
           + illegible
       248 +  - **H2 (One team per day):** Verify walker doesn't appear 
           + on multiple teams
       249 +  
       250 +  #### Step 2.7: Document Findings
       251 +  
       252 +  **For CONFIRMED records:** Add to verification summary (no 
           + issue needed)
       253 +  
       254 +  **For DISCREPANCIES:** Create QA Issue in runsheet using 
           + template:
       255 +  
       256 +  ```markdown
       257 +  ## QA Issue #[N]: [DATE] Team [X] - [FIELD]
       258 +  
       259 +  **Problem:** [One sentence describing what's wrong]
       260 +  
       261 +  **Fix:** [One sentence describing the correction]
       262 +  
       263 +  **Sources consulted:**
       264 +  1. [PDF filename] — [form/page]
       265 +  2. [Diary filename] — [date entry]
       266 +  
       267 +  **Source evidence:**
       268 +  - PDF: "[relevant excerpt]"
       269 +  - Diary: "[relevant excerpt]"
       270 +  
       271 +  **Finding:** DISCREPANCY / MISSING / SOURCE GAP
       272 +  **Recommended value:** [value]
       273 +  
       274 +  **Reasoning:**
       275 +  [Why this value is correct, referencing source priority 
           + rules]
       276 +  
       277 +  ---
       278 +  **User Decision:** [ ] Accept / [ ] Modify: _______________
       279 +  ```
       280 +  
       281 +  **For MISSING RECORDS:** Always document as MAJOR QA Issue
       282 +  
       283 +  ### Phase 3: Cross-Record Checks
       284 +  
       285 +  After verifying all individual records:
       286 +  
       287 +  #### 3.1: Unit Continuity Check
       288 +  
       289 +  Create a unit continuity table for the entire record set:
       290 +  
       291 +  ```markdown
       292 +  | Date | End Unit | Next Date | Start Unit | Gap | Status |
       293 +  |------|----------|-----------|------------|-----|--------|
       294 +  | [date] | [end] | [date] | [start] | [+/-N] | ✓ / ⚠ |
       295 +  ```
       296 +  
       297 +  - Gap of +1: Normal (continuous)
       298 +  - Gap of 0: Overlap (same unit, may be valid)
       299 +  - Gap > +1: Investigate — may indicate missing records
       300 +  - Negative gap: Error — units shouldn't go backwards
       301 +  
       302 +  **IMPORTANT:** Unit gaps often indicate missing CSV 
           + records, not missing field days. Always check PDF and diary 
           + for the gap dates.
       303 +  
       304 +  #### 3.2: Source Coverage Matrix
       305 +  
       306 +  Document source availability for all records:
       307 +  
       308 +  ```markdown
       309 +  | Date | PDF Form | Primary Diary | Secondary Diary | CSV 
           + Status | Notes |
       310 +  |------|----------|---------------|-----------------|------
           + ------|-------|
       311 +  | [date] | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗ | ✓/✗/N/A | Present/Missing/Added | 
           + [notes] |
       312 +  ```
       313 +  
       314 +  #### 3.3: Walker Consistency Check
       315 +  
       316 +  - [ ] No duplicate walkers within any record
       317 +  - [ ] Walker names consistently standardised across records
       318 +  - [ ] Leaders always included in walker lists
       319 +  
       320 +  ### Phase 4: Documentation Outputs
       321 +  
       322 +  A complete QA run must produce:
       323 +  
       324 +  #### 4.1: QA Runsheet 
           + (`outputs/qa-runsheet-[area]-[season].md`)
       325 +  
       326 +  Required sections:
       327 +  
       328 +  1. **Header:** Date, scope (record count), status
       329 +  2. **Source Documents Consulted:** Table of files used
       330 +  3. **Per-Record Verification Results:** Comparison tables
       331 +  4. **QA Issues:** All discrepancies with full issue format
       332 +  5. **Source Coverage Matrix:** Complete source availability
       333 +  6. **Unit Continuity Check:** Full continuity table
       334 +  7. **Summary:** Counts by category, corrections applied
       335 +  
       336 +  #### 4.2: Discrepancies Log 
           + (`docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md`)
       337 +  
       338 +  Add entries for:
       339 +  
       340 +  - **Value discrepancies (Dxxx):** PDF vs Diary conflicts, 
           + CSV errors
       341 +  - **Missing records (Dxxx):** Records that should exist but
           +  don't
       342 +  - **Source gaps (Sxxx):** Missing PDF or diary entries
       343 +  - Each entry must include: source values, resolution, 
           + reasoning
       344 +  
       345 +  #### 4.3: Updated attribution.csv
       346 +  
       347 +  After user approval:
       348 +  
       349 +  - Apply accepted corrections
       350 +  - Add missing records (if any)
       351 +  - Update Extraction_Notes with QA provenance
       352 +  
       353 +  ### Phase 5: Summary Statistics
       354 +  
       355 +  Record final counts:
       356 +  
       357 +  ```markdown
       358 +  | Metric | Count |
       359 +  |--------|-------|
       360 +  | Records verified | [N] |
       361 +  | MAJOR issues | [N] |
       362 +  | Minor issues | [N] |
       363 +  | Corrections applied | [N] |
       364 +  | Missing records added | [N] |
       365 +  | Source gaps documented | [N] |
       366 +  ```
       367 +

       369 +  
       370 +  ## Checklist: What to Record
       371 +  
       372 +  Use this checklist to ensure nothing is missed during QA:
       373 +

  Key Additions

  Phase-based workflow:
  1. Pre-QA Setup — Identify records, locate sources, create inventory
  2. Per-Record Verification — 7 steps for each record
  3. Cross-Record Checks — Unit continuity, source coverage matrix, walker
  consistency
  4. Documentation Outputs — Required runsheet, discrepancies log, CSV
  updates
  5. Summary Statistics — Final counts and metrics

  Templates provided for:
  - Source inventory tables
  - Field comparison tables
  - QA Issue format
  - Unit continuity tables
  - Source coverage matrix

  Checklists for:
  - Per-record requirements
  - Per-record-set requirements
  - Documentation requirements
  - Red flags to watch for

  This protocol should enable consistent, repeatable QA whether performed by
   Claude, Gemini, or a human reviewer.

> in the value discrepancies, in which case was the diary preferred over the
 pdf? 

● You're right to question that — I misstated it. Looking back at the data:

  None. The diary was never preferred over the PDF.

  The breakdown is actually:

  | Scenario                             | Count | Cases
      |
  |--------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------
  ----|
  | PDF explicitly preferred over diary  | 5     | D001, D002, D003, D004,
  D006 |
  | PDF and diary agreed (CSV was wrong) | 2     | D005, D007
      |
  | Diary preferred over PDF             | 0     | —
      |

  My "6/7" was misleading. In all 7 value discrepancies, either:
  - PDF was chosen over diary (5 cases), or
  - Both sources agreed and the CSV was simply wrong (2 cases)

  This strongly reinforces observation O1 (PDF more reliable for unit
  numbers). We haven't yet encountered a case where the diary was correct
  and the PDF was wrong for basic numeric data.

> Can you plese include this scenario table in the report? If you are going 
to abbreviate it in the 'Summary', be a little more specific (PDF and diary 
agree 2/7; PDF preferred 5/7) and make sure that the options add up to the 
whole (e.g., 7/7)

● Done. The discrepancies log now includes the scenario table with explicit
  fractions that sum to the total:

  | Diary preferred over PDF | 0 | 0/7 | — |
  | **Total** | **7** | **7/7** | |

  With interpretation noting that in all PDF vs diary conflicts, PDF was
  preferred — supporting O1.

> Ok, great, I just want to make sure the results are easily interpretable 
by others - or by me in six months!\

Next, 'PDF' is a little vague, we have lots of PDFs. Can you change 'PDF' in
 these to 'DPF scan' (= 'Daily Progress Form scan')

            end unit and Nov 2 start unit suggests either: (a) unit 61549
             was walked on both days, or (b) there's a boundary/overlap 
            convention. This is not an error, just an observation.

● Now let me update the qa-guidance.md to use "DPF scan" consistently as
  well:

       18    
       19    ## Source Priority Rules
       20    
       21 +  **Note:** "DPF scan" = Daily Progress Form scan (the scanned
          +  PDF of the handwritten daily summary forms completed in the 
          + field).
       22 +  
       23    ### For Basic Information (Walkers, Units, Dates)
       24    
       25 -  1. **PDF Daily Progress Forms
          -  ** — PRIMARY source; more accurate for numeric/factual data
       25 +  1. **DPF scans
          +  ** — PRIMARY source; more accurate for numeric/factual data
       26    2. **Diaries** — Cross-reference for name interpretation and
             context
       27    3. **Both together** — Required for high confidence
       28    
       29    ### For Role Information (PDA, GPS, Paper Recorder, etc.)
       30    
       31    1. **Diaries** — PRIMARY and often ONLY source for role 
            assignments
       32 -  2. **PDF Daily Progress Forms
          -  ** — Do NOT reliably indicate Paper Recorder (see O3 below)
       32 +  2. **DPF scans
          +  ** — Do NOT reliably indicate Paper Recorder (see O3 below)
       33    
       34    ### Conflict Resolution
       35    
       36 -  - PDF summary forms 
          -  take precedence for basic info when conflicting with diaries
       36 +  - DPF scans 
          +  take precedence for basic info when conflicting with diaries
       37    - Document all conflicts in discrepancies log with reasoning
       38    - Flag genuinely ambiguous cases for user decision
       39    
     ...
       39    
       40    For every record, document which sources were available:
       41    
       42 -  - **PDF Daily Progress Form:** Present / Missing
       42 +  - **DPF scan:** Present / Missing
       43    - **Primary Diary Entry:** Present / Missing
       44    - **Secondary Diary Entry:** Present / Missing / N/A
       45    
     ...
       51    
       52    Use this to validate source priority:
       53    
       54 -  - If PDF 
          -  creates a gap/overlap with adjacent days but diary doesn't →
          -   evidence to prefer diary
       55 -  - If diary creates a gap/overlap but PDF doesn't → confirms 
          -  PDF as PRIMARY
       54 +  - If DPF scan 
          +  creates a gap/overlap with adjacent days but diary doesn't →
          +   evidence to prefer diary
       55 +  - If diary creates a gap/overlap but DPF scan 
          +  doesn't → confirms DPF scan as PRIMARY
       56    - Document all continuity anomalies in discrepancies log

  ⎿  Updated docs/qa-guidance.md with 6 additions and 6 removals         
       129    The CSV now uses two distinct author fields:
       130    
       131    - **Diary_Author** — Person who wrote the diary/narrative 
             entry for that day
       132 -  - **Summary_Author** — Person who filled out the PDF 
           -  Daily Progress Form
       132 +  - **Summary_Author** — Person who filled out the DPF (
           +  Daily Progress Form)
       133    
       134    These are often different people. The diary author writes 
             the detailed narrative; the summary author completes the 
             standardised form at end of day.

       137    
       138 -  **Initial hypothesis:** PDF form 
           -  "Author" = Paper Recorder role
       138 +  **Initial hypothesis:** DPF "Author" = Paper Recorder role
       139    
       140 -  **Testing:** Compared Team B diary (which explicitly names 
           -  "Paper Records" / "Documents" roles) against PDF
           -   Author field.
       140 +  **Testing:** Compared Team B diary (which explicitly names 
           +  "Paper Records" / "Documents" roles) against DPF
           +   Author field.
       141    
       142    **Result:** Only 2 of 6 records matched. The hypothesis is 
             **not supported**.
       143    
       144 -  **Conclusion:** The PDF
           -   Author and the diary-assigned "Paper Records" role appear 
           -  to be different tasks:

● Done. All references to "PDF" have been changed to "DPF scan" in both
  documents (except for PDF_Source which is a column name in the CSV).

  Summary of changes:

  1. docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md:
    - All 10 discrepancy entries (D001-D009) now use "DPF scan"
    - All 3 source gap entries (S001-S003) now use "DPF scan"
    - Summary tables updated
    - Added definition note: "DPF scan" = Daily Progress Form scan
  2. docs/qa-guidance.md:
    - Source Priority Rules section updated
    - Observations (O1, O2, O3) updated
    - Full QA Protocol workflow updated
    - All templates and checklists updated
    - Added definition note at start of Source Priority Rules

  The terminology is now specific and unambiguous — "DPF scan" clearly
  refers to the scanned Daily Progress Forms, distinguishing them from other
   PDFs in the archive.

> ok, great, one final thing - before we started these corrections, I had 
intended to snapshot the complete-but-uncorrected attribution.csv - could 
you look at the git history and retrieve that? After we are all done, I want
 to use it as a comparison, plus I want to run it through Gemini for a 
comparison between your performance and Gemini 3. Save it...somewhere 
logical in the archive would be fine, so long as it is clearly named and I 
can find it. We may in future take additional 'snapshots' like this.

  | Post-QA (current) | 270     | Split Diary_Author / Summary_Author |

  Key differences in snapshot:
  - Walker duplicates present (77 records)
  - Missing records (7 Nov, 10 Nov Team B)
  - Unit errors (D005: 71245→71525, D006: 71650→71649, D007:
  empty→71713/71760)

  I've also created archive/snapshots/README.md documenting the naming
  convention and how to create future snapshots. This will serve as your
  baseline for the Gemini comparison.

● Now let me update the discrepancies log as well:

● Search(pattern: "Summary_Author", path: "docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Search(pattern: "Summary_Author", path: "docs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Search(pattern: "Summary_Author", path: "outputs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Done. All references updated:

  CSV:
  - Column renamed: Summary_Author → DPF_Author

  Documentation (docs/qa-guidance.md):
  - Observation O2: "Diary Author ≠ DPF Author"
  - Observation O3: "DPF Author ≠ Paper Recorder"
  - Field descriptions updated
  - Error severity table updated

  The terminology is now consistent: "DPF" refers to Daily Progress Forms
  throughout.

● /compact QA Pilot Completion and Protocol Documentation

  Project: TRAP Attribution Extraction QA
  Session: Continuation of QA pilot, focusing on documentation and
  terminology standardisation

  ## Work Completed This Session

  1. **Verified pilot completion status**
     - 16 records verified (5 Team A, 11 Team B including 2 missing records
  added)
     - 270 records in attribution.csv (was 268)
     - All 10 QA issues resolved and corrections applied

  2. **Wrote comprehensive QA Protocol** (`docs/qa-guidance.md`)
     - 5-phase workflow: Pre-QA Setup → Per-Record Verification →
  Cross-Record Checks → Documentation Outputs → Summary Statistics
     - Templates for comparison tables, QA issues, source coverage matrix
     - Checklists for per-record and per-record-set requirements
     - Red flags and systematic checks

  3. **Terminology standardisation: "PDF" → "DPF scan"**
     - Updated all references in `docs/qa-guidance.md`
     - Updated all references in `docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md`
     - "DPF scan" = Daily Progress Form scan (scanned PDF of handwritten
  daily summary forms)

  4. **Column rename: `Summary_Author` → `DPF_Author`**
     - Updated `outputs/attribution.csv` header
     - Updated all documentation references

  5. **Added Value Discrepancy Resolution table**
  (`docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md`)
     - DPF scan and diary agreed (CSV wrong): 2/7
     - DPF scan preferred over diary: 5/7
     - Diary preferred over DPF scan: 0/7
     - Total: 7/7

  6. **Created pre-correction snapshot** for Gemini comparison
     - `archive/snapshots/attribution-2025-11-26-pre-qa-pilot.csv`
     - 267 records, original schema (single `Author` column)
     - Created `archive/snapshots/README.md` with naming convention

  ## Key Files Modified
  - `docs/qa-guidance.md` — Now 440+ lines with complete QA protocol
  - `docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md` — Updated terminology, added resolution
  table
  - `outputs/attribution.csv` — Column renamed
  - `outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2010-autumn.md` — Status marked COMPLETE

  ## Uncommitted Changes
  - All QA corrections to attribution.csv (unit fixes, missing records,
  walker dedup, schema changes)
  - All documentation updates
  - Snapshot files

  ## Ready For
  - Git commit of all changes
  - Gemini comparison using pre-correction snapshot
  - Scaling QA methodology to remaining ~254 records
