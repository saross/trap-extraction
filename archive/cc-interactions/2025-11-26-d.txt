● Continuing with the task to update source-inventory.md with correct ELH
  2009 diary listings. Let me first read the current file to see what needs
  to be updated.

● Read(outputs/source-inventory.md)
  ⎿  Read 395 lines

● Now I can see the current source-inventory.md. I need to update the Elhovo
   2009 section with the correct file sizes. The current listing shows
  incorrect sizes (e.g., "55 KB" for TeamB_Dnevnik when actual is 98 KB).
  Let me update this section with accurate information.

● Update(outputs/source-inventory.md)
  ⎿  Updated outputs/source-inventory.md with 6 additions and 6 removals

       350    ### Version Notes and Annotations
       351    
       352    **Elhovo 2009:**
       353 -  - **Team A:** "Diary Team A.doc" 
           -  is PRIMARY. "Diary_Aneta.doc" (29
           -   KB, SUPPLEMENTAL) is a personal diary by team member 
           -  Aneta, providing individual perspective rather than 
           -  official team record. Duplicate copy exists in 
           -  `Reports/Otchet/BG Diaries/`.
       354 -  - **Team B:** "DiaryTeamB.doc" (EN) is PRIMARY. 
           - "TeamB_Dnevnik (Ross).doc" (55 KB BG, SECONDARY) is 
           - Bulgarian version by Ross. Duplicate copy exists in 
           - `Reports/Otchet/BG Diaries/`.
       353 +  - **Team A:** "Diary Team A.doc" (132 KB, EN) 
           +  is PRIMARY. "Diary_Aneta.doc" (44
           +   KB, SUPPLEMENTAL) is a personal diary by team member 
           +  Aneta, providing individual perspective rather than 
           +  official team record. Duplicate copy exists in 
           +  `Reports/Otchet/BG Diaries/`.
       354 +  - **Team B:** "DiaryTeamB.doc" (97 KB, EN) is PRIMARY - 
           + contains complete daily narrative entries from 10 October 
           + through 21 November 2009. "TeamB_Dnevnik (Ross).doc" (98 KB,
           +  BG, SECONDARY) is Bulgarian version by Ross with similar 
           + coverage. EN PRIMARY despite near-identical file size 
           + because EN diary has more detailed narrative structure; BG 
           + version useful for cross-verification. Duplicate copy exists
           +  in `Reports/Otchet/BG Diaries/`. QA verified 26 November 
           + 2025.
       355 +  - **Team C:** "The Diary of Team C.doc" (103 KB, EN) is 
           + PRIMARY. "TeamC_Dnevnik.doc" (41 KB, BG, SECONDARY) is 
           + Bulgarian version with less detail.
       356    
       357    **Elhovo 2010:**
       358    - **Team B versions:** Four diary files exist for Team B 
             2010. File comparison analysis (23 November 2025) determined
              that "Team B Diary new.docx" (26 KB, March 2011) is PRIMARY
              as it contains critical post-season data quality 
             corrections including: corrected object numbers, annotations
              flagging data errors (e.g., "no such artefact brought to 
             base"), and added missing object records. The December 2010 
             versions represent the original field recordings. "Diary" vs
              "Journal" naming is meaningless - these are duplicate files
              with different names. Initial data extraction was performed
              from "Team B Diary.docx" (SECONDARY); attribution CSV 
             updated on 23 November 2025 to use PRIMARY version data for 
             all affected records.

● Now let me update the Extraction Status section to reflect that Elhovo
  2009 Team B has been verified:

● Update(outputs/source-inventory.md)
  ⎿  Updated outputs/source-inventory.md with 1 addition and 1 removal

● Now let me update the todo list to reflect the completed work:

● All tasks from the previous session have been completed:

  Summary of Completed Work

  1. CSV Corrections Applied (D011-D014)

  Applied the approved corrections to attribution.csv:
  - D011: Added units 70926/70962 to 2009-11-02 Team B
  - D012: Added units 70963/71062 to 2009-11-03 Team B
  - D013: Added units 71063/71142 to 2009-11-05 Team B
  - D014: Removed erroneous QA_Notes from all 3 records

  2. Source Inventory Updated (outputs/source-inventory.md)

  Updated Elhovo 2009 diary listings with verified file sizes:

  | Team | File                     | Size   | Version        |
  |------|--------------------------|--------|----------------|
  | A    | Diary Team A.doc         | 132 KB | PRIMARY        |
  | A    | Diary_Aneta.doc          | 44 KB  | SUPPLEMENTAL   |
  | B    | DiaryTeamB.doc           | 97 KB  | PRIMARY (EN)   |
  | B    | TeamB_Dnevnik (Ross).doc | 98 KB  | SECONDARY (BG) |
  | C    | The Diary of Team C.doc  | 103 KB | PRIMARY        |
  | C    | TeamC_Dnevnik.doc        | 41 KB  | SECONDARY      |

  Also updated:
  - Version Notes section with detailed Team B, C annotations
  - Extraction Status section noting Team B QA completed
  - Document history with today's date

  3. Discrepancies Log Updated (docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md)

  Marked D011-D014 as ✅ Done in the Action Items section.

  All documentation is now consistent with the QA work completed for Elhovo
  2009 Autumn Team B.

> with the diaries, plese be consistent marking them with (EN) and (BG), 
that's helpful. Out of an excess of caution, can I also confirm that you've 
written all discrepencies found in the target file (attribution.csv) and 
discrepencies between sources? There may not be any of the latter, since the
 DPFs are missing... 

● Good points. Let me first fix the consistency issue in
  source-inventory.md, then verify the CSV corrections and confirm all
  discrepancies are documented.

● Update(outputs/source-inventory.md)
  ⎿  Updated outputs/source-inventory.md with 6 additions and 6 removals

● Now let me verify the CSV corrections were actually applied by checking
  the relevant records:

● Bash(grep -E "^2009-11-0[235],B"
      /media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-2

    … +12 lines (ctrl+o to expand)




● CSV corrections confirmed. Now let me check the QA runsheet to verify all
  discrepancies between sources (EN vs BG diary) are documented:

● Read(outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2009-autumn-b.md)
  ⎿  Read 324 lines

● Verification Complete

  1. CSV Corrections Confirmed ✓

  All three records now have the correct unit numbers:

  | Date       | Start Unit | End Unit | QA_Notes
            |
  |------------|------------|----------|------------------------------------
  ----------|
  | 2009-11-02 | 70926      | 70962    | QA 2025-11-26: Units added from
  diary (D011) |
  | 2009-11-03 | 70963      | 71062    | QA 2025-11-26: Units added from
  diary (D012) |
  | 2009-11-05 | 71063      | 71142    | QA 2025-11-26: Units added from
  diary (D013) |

  2. Source-to-Source Discrepancies

  You're correct — since there are no DPF scans for ELH 2009, the only
  cross-source verification was EN diary vs BG diary.

  Finding: NO discrepancies between EN and BG diaries. Both sources agreed
  on all unit values:

  | Date       | EN Diary    | BG Diary    | Agreement |
  |------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
  | 2009-11-02 | 70926-70962 | 70926-70962 | ✓ Perfect |
  | 2009-11-03 | 70963-71062 | 70963-71062 | ✓ Perfect |
  | 2009-11-05 | 71063-71142 | 71063-71142 | ✓ Perfect |

  All 20 records showed EN/BG agreement on walker names and unit numbers.

  3. What Was Documented

  | Type      | Description                               | Location
                            |
  |-----------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------
  --------------------------|
  | D011-D014 | CSV extraction errors (missing unit data) |
  qa-discrepancies-log.md                   |
  | S004      | Season-wide source gap (no DPF scans)     |
  qa-discrepancies-log.md                   |
  | Issue #5  | UNMAPPED: Lizzy                           | QA runsheet
  (already in name-mapping.csv) |

  Summary

  The discrepancies found were all CSV vs source errors (data not
  extracted), not source vs source conflicts. The EN and BG diaries were
  fully consistent, which gives high confidence in the diary-derived values
  despite the absence of DPF scans.

> ok, I think I'd like to do an experiment to see if it's worthwhile to look
 at the survey unit record sheets. I've avoided doing so because they are 
hard to read, and generally unnecessary when the daily summary is present - 
but since it isn't present here, perhaps it's worth it. First, can you tell 
me how complete you judge these records to be, that will help us decide if 
looking at the SU sheets is worthwhile? 

● Good question. Let me assess the completeness of the Elhovo 2009 Team B
  records to help you decide.

  | Nov 9-13   | ? Lizzy (unmapped)    | ✗         | ✗       | ✗     |

  SU Form PDFs Available

  14 PDFs exist, corresponding to these survey dates:

  | PDF Unit     | Date   | Could help with roles?      |
  |--------------|--------|-----------------------------|
  | 70970, 71062 | Nov 3  | ✓ Yes — role gap            |
  | 71199        | Nov 6  | ✓ Yes — role gap            |
  | 71257        | Nov 7  | Partial (already have some) |
  | 71370        | Nov 10 | Could verify Lizzy          |
  | 71463        | Nov 13 | Could verify Lizzy          |

  Missing SU forms: Nov 2, Nov 5, Nov 9, Nov 12

  Verdict

  Core data is 100% complete. The gaps are in role assignments (PDA, GPS,
  Paper Recorder), particularly for Nov 2-6.

  The SU forms might help fill 2-3 role gaps (Nov 3, 6, 7) and possibly
  verify "Lizzy" — but they won't fill Nov 2, Nov 5, Nov 9, Nov 12 since no
  PDFs exist for those units.

  Worth looking at? Marginal benefit. You'd gain at most 3-4 role data
  points. If the SU forms are hard to read and the diary didn't record
  roles, the forms may not either. Want me to sample one (e.g., 70970.pdf
  for Nov 3) to see what information it actually contains?

> Why don't we try one just to see what we learn. 70970.pdf is a good place 
to start. Can you use your vision engine and tell me what you see, then I'll
 give you additional guidance. For orientation, these forms are printed 
four-to-a-page. You're interested (usually) in the *bottom* form, which is 
the *first* form on the sheet, as fieldwalkers found it more intuitive to 
work their way *up* the page as they walked forward. This bottom record 
should contain the names or initials of the field walkers, which you can 
cross-check with the diary since they are often hard to read. The date is 
also written into this form (here abbreviated to just '29', assuming month 
and year). Many forms have marginal notes that may also be useful, e.g., 
stating roles or expanding initials. Why don't you have a look and see what 
you can interpret, and I'll be here to help. 

● Let me take a look at that survey unit form:

      B/FieldRecords/70970.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (2.5MB)

● This is very informative! Let me describe what I see:

  Document Structure

  - 34 pages, each with 4 forms arranged vertically
  - Mix of INTENSIVE SURVEY (15m intervals) and EXTENSIVE SURVEY (20m
  intervals) forms
  - Covers units from approximately 70940 to 71062 (late October through
  November 3, 2009)
  - Header shows "ELHOVO 2009"

  Bottom Form Analysis (Page 1 - Unit 70940, Date: 29 October)

  Walker Position Box (bottom left):
  1. Stamosh (Stanislav)
  2. Shawn
  3. Vera
  4. Scott
  5. [possibly empty or initial]

  Notes field: "Start time: 8:23" and "Frag = 4 walkers"

  Cross-check with diary (Oct 29): Diary says "Scott, Vera, Shawn, Stanislav
   (4)" — matches! ✓

  Other Observations

  Marginal notes (handwritten in brown ink):
  - "end of the field" markers between forms
  - Page 1 has: "mostly Roman material including brick, tiles, also ceramic 
  medieval and others..."
  - These are archaeological observation notes, not role assignments

  What the forms provide:
  - ✓ Walker names/initials (in numbered position boxes)
  - ✓ Date (abbreviated, e.g., "29" for Oct 29, "H.3" for Nov 3)
  - ✓ Unit numbers
  - ✓ Walk interval

  What the forms DON'T provide:
  - ✗ No role fields (PDA, GPS, Paper Recorder not recorded on these forms)
  - ✗ No "Author" field like the DPF daily summary forms have

  Verdict for Role Data

  The SU forms are useful for confirming walker names but won't help fill 
  role gaps — the forms simply don't have fields for recording who operated
  the PDA, GPS, or did paper recording. That information was only tracked
  (when it was tracked) in the diaries.

  Do you want me to check a November form (when Dasha replaced Vera) to
  verify the walker change, or shall we conclude the experiment here?

> Yes, that's good. Some other visual queues: an 'X' through one or more 
boxes indicates an area that was not surveyed for one reason or another - so
 if an entire 'column' is Xed out, only expect four walkers (sometimes even 
more columns will be Xed out - and sometimes *extra* columns will be hand 
drawn in; the number of columns not Xed out indicates the expected number of
 walkers). On this particular form, the marginal notes are archaeological 
(expect those) but I have recently seen forms with role assignments (not 
consistently though) - just be primed to examine marginal notes and look for
 relevant information if it's there. Uses for these forms include: 
confirming walkers and confirming dates. If you use it in this way, please 
indicate so. 

● Thank you for the additional guidance. Let me summarise what we've learned
   from this experiment:

  SU Form Interpretation Guide

  Visual cues for walker count:
  - X through column(s) = area not surveyed → fewer walkers than 5
  - Hand-drawn extra columns = more than 5 walkers
  - Count non-Xed columns = actual walker count for that unit

  Marginal notes:
  - Often archaeological (material descriptions, site observations)
  - Occasionally contain role assignments — worth examining but not
  systematic
  - Look for keywords like "PDA", "GPS", "forms", "recorder", names with
  role annotations

  Value of SU Forms for QA

  | Use                     | Reliability
                |
  |-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------
  --------------|
  | Confirming walker names | ✓ Good — names in position boxes
                |
  | Confirming dates        | ✓ Good — date field on each form
                |
  | Confirming walker count | ✓ Good — count non-Xed columns
                |
  | Role assignments        | ✗ Poor — no dedicated field; occasional
  marginal notes only |

  Conclusion

  For Elhovo 2009 Team B, the SU forms are not worth systematically 
  reviewing for our current QA purposes because:
  1. Walker names are already confirmed via EN/BG diary agreement
  2. Dates are already confirmed
  3. Role data (our main gap) isn't reliably recorded on these forms

  The forms would be valuable if we had conflicting walker information
  between sources, or if diary entries were missing — they could serve as a
  third verification source. For now, the diary-only verification is
  sufficient given the EN/BG agreement.

  Should I note this finding in the QA guidance document for future
  reference?

> ah, and *confirming unit numbers*! 

● Yes, of course! That's actually one of the most direct uses — the unit
  number is written right on each form. Updated:

  Value of SU Forms for QA

  | Use                     | Reliability
                |
  |-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------
  --------------|
  | Confirming unit numbers | ✓ Direct — unit number field on each form
                |
  | Confirming walker names | ✓ Good — names in position boxes
                |
  | Confirming walker count | ✓ Good — count non-Xed columns
                |
  | Confirming dates        | ✓ Good — date field on each form
                |
  | Role assignments        | ✗ Poor — no dedicated field; occasional
  marginal notes only |

  This is particularly valuable for ELH 2009 where no DPF scans exist — the
  SU forms become the only primary source to cross-verify unit numbers
  against diary entries. If we ever doubted the diary's unit numbers (e.g.,
  suspected a transcription error), the SU forms would be the definitive
  source since the unit number is recorded in the field at the time of
  survey.

  Should I add this to the QA guidance document under a new section for
  "Tier 4 Sources (SU Forms)" with notes on when they're useful?

> Yes, please add - if the information extracted from the diaries is 
*coherent* (e.g., no unexpected changes of walkers - like a single walker 
being different on one day - continuous unit numbers, dates match between 
the attribution CSV and the diaries, etc.), then I don't think it's 
necessary to fall back to the diaries, which are admittedly high-effort to 
interpret. BUT if anything looks suspicious, we should fall back to the 
diaries.\
\
One other question - would it be possible to set up a dedicated scan of the 
diaries to look for the (uncommon but extant) statement of roles? We won't 
do that now, but we could do it later as a dedicated task.

       432    
       433 +  ## Tier 4 Sources: Survey Unit (SU) Forms
       434 +  
       435 +  Individual survey unit forms (scanned PDFs) provide 
           + field-level data recorded at the time of survey. These are a
           +  fallback verification source when primary sources (DPF 
           + scans, diaries) are unavailable or suspicious.
       436 +  
       437 +  ### When to Use SU Forms
       438 +  
       439 +  **Use SU forms when diary data looks suspicious:**
       440 +  
       441 +  - Unexpected walker changes (single day differs from 
           + surrounding days)
       442 +  - Unit number gaps or discontinuities
       443 +  - Date mismatches between CSV and diary
       444 +  - Walker count inconsistencies
       445 +  
       446 +  **Do NOT routinely check SU forms if diary data is 
           + coherent:**
       447 +  
       448 +  - Continuous unit numbers across days
       449 +  - Consistent walker composition (expected team stability)
       450 +  - Dates match between sources
       451 +  - No unexplained anomalies
       452 +  
       453 +  SU forms are **high-effort to interpret** (handwritten, 4 
           + forms per page, variable legibility). Only use when needed.
       454 +  
       455 +  ### What SU Forms Provide
       456 +  
       457 +  | Data | Reliability | Location on Form |
       458 +  |------|-------------|------------------|
       459 +  | Unit numbers | ✓ Direct | "Survey unit:" field |
       460 +  | Walker names | ✓ Good | Bottom-left position boxes (1-5) 
           + |
       461 +  | Walker count | ✓ Good | Count non-Xed columns |
       462 +  | Dates | ✓ Good | "Date:" field (often abbreviated) |
       463 +  | Role assignments | ✗ Poor | Occasional marginal notes 
           + only |
       464 +  
       465 +  ### Reading SU Forms
       466 +  
       467 +  **Form layout:**
       468 +  - 4 forms per page, arranged vertically
       469 +  - **Bottom form = first unit** (fieldwalkers work upward on
           +  the page)
       470 +  - Walker names in numbered position boxes (bottom-left 
           + corner)
       471 +  
       472 +  **Visual cues:**
       473 +  - **X through column(s):** Area not surveyed → fewer 
           + walkers
       474 +  - **Hand-drawn extra columns:** More than 5 walkers
       475 +  - **Count non-Xed columns:** Actual walker count
       476 +  
       477 +  **Marginal notes:**
       478 +  - Often archaeological observations (materials found, site 
           + conditions)
       479 +  - Occasionally contain role assignments — examine but don't
           +  rely on
       480 +  - Look for keywords: "PDA", "GPS", "forms", "recorder"
       481 +  
       482 +  ### SU Forms for Seasons Without DPF Scans
       483 +  
       484 +  For seasons like **Elhovo 2009** where no DPF scans exist, 
           + SU forms become the **only primary field source** to 
           + cross-verify unit numbers against diary entries. The unit 
           + number on each SU form is recorded in the field at the time 
           + of survey, making it definitive.
       485 +  
       486 +  ---
       487 +  
       488    ## Future Additions
       489    
       490 +  ### Potential Future Tasks
       491 +  
       492 +  1. **Dedicated SU form scan for role data:** Systematically
           +  review SU form marginal notes across all available PDFs to 
           + extract occasional role assignments. High effort but could 
           + yield some role data for records currently missing this 
           + information.
       493 +  
       494    *Add new rules, heuristics, or observations here as QA 
             progresses*
       495    
       496    ---

● Done. Now to your question about a dedicated scan for role statements:

  Feasibility: Dedicated SU Form Scan for Roles

  Yes, this is possible. Here's how it could work:

  Approach

  1. Scope: Review all SU form PDFs page by page (14 files for Team B alone,
   ~30+ pages each)
  2. Target: Marginal notes containing role-related keywords:
    - "PDA", "GPS", "forms", "recorder", "paper"
    - Names followed by role indicators
    - Any annotations near the walker position boxes
  3. Output: A supplementary table of role assignments extracted from SU
  forms, with:
    - Date, Unit range, Role, Person, Source (PDF filename + page)

  Effort Estimate

  | Season/Team        | PDF Count | Est. Pages | Effort   |
  |--------------------|-----------|------------|----------|
  | ELH 2009 Team B    | 14        | ~400       | High     |
  | ELH 2009 Teams A+C | ~25       | ~700       | High     |
  | Other seasons      | Variable  | Variable   | Variable |

  Trade-offs

  Pros:
  - Could recover some role data otherwise lost
  - Vision-based scanning is now feasible (as we just demonstrated)
  - One-time effort with permanent benefit

  Cons:
  - Role notes are uncommon — yield may be low
  - Time-intensive manual review
  - Handwriting legibility varies

  Recommendation

  Add to the backlog as a low-priority enhancement task — worth doing
  eventually, but not critical given that role data is "bonus" information
  rather than core attribution data.

  Would you like me to create a task specification document for this future
  work?

> Since you have recent experience looking at the scans, and we've discussed
 it in this session, yes, while it's in context please write up a 
preliminary plan for a 'Dedicated SU Form Scan for Roles'

  Plan Summary

  Objective: Extract role assignments from SU form marginal notes

  Recommended approach: Phased execution
  1. Pilot (2-3 hours): ELH 2009 Team B, November dates only — assess yield
  2. Expansion (12-15 hours): If pilot yield >20%, extend to all ELH 2009
  teams
  3. Full scan (+5-10 hours): Add ELH 2010 if expansion successful

  Key methodology points:
  - Review page by page using vision capability
  - Look for marginal notes with role indicators (PDA, GPS, Forms, etc.)
  - Record findings with source location and confidence level
  - Cross-reference against existing diary data before updating CSV

  Success criterion: >20% yield rate in pilot to justify expansion

  Outputs:
  - su-form-role-extractions.csv with structured findings
  - Updated attribution.csv with validated role data
  - Extraction log documenting effort and yield

  The plan captures what we learned from today's experiment and provides a
  framework for executing the task whenever it gets prioritised. Ready to
  pick up when you want to tackle it.

> thanks - I'd like to continue the manual QA check of the season we're 
working on in the next session, but we're low on context, can you write a 
/compact message? 

● Session Summary for /compact

  Session focus: Completed QA for Elhovo 2009 Autumn Team B (20 records) and
   explored SU form utility.

  Completed This Session

  1. Applied CSV corrections (D011-D014):
    - Added unit numbers to 2009-11-02, 2009-11-03, 2009-11-05 Team B
    - Removed erroneous QA_Notes claiming "no autumn survey season"
    - Updated discrepancies log marking all as ✅ Done
  2. Updated source-inventory.md:
    - Corrected ELH 2009 diary file sizes (Team A: 132KB, Team B EN:
  97KB/BG: 98KB, Team C: 103KB/41KB)
    - Added (EN)/(BG) language markers consistently
    - Noted Team B QA completed
  3. SU Form Experiment:
    - Examined 70970.pdf to assess utility for role data extraction
    - Findings: SU forms confirm walker names, dates, unit numbers; do NOT
  have role fields
    - Marginal notes occasionally contain role info but not systematic
    - Added "Tier 4 Sources: Survey Unit (SU) Forms" section to
  qa-guidance.md
  4. Created plan document:
    - docs/plan-su-form-role-scan.md — detailed plan for future dedicated
  role extraction from SU forms
    - Phased approach: pilot (2-3 hrs) → expansion if yield >20%
