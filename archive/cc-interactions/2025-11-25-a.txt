forward to working with you to finish this project. Can you please review 
trap-extraction/archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-25-a.txt to see where we 
left off? If you need more context, examine earlier interactions exports. 
Also please look at the documents in planning/, and let's discuss what to do
 next.

  What would you like to focus on next?

  Options I see:

  1. Task 3: Name standardisation - Apply the name-mapping document
  systematically to all personnel columns
  2. Task 5: QA exercise - Run comprehensive validation checks
  3. Task 7: Data dictionary - Document all columns for AKB submission
  4. Something else - Let me know what's most pressing for the submission
  timeline

> Let's undertake name standardisation. looking at 'Walkers_Original' in 
'attribution.csv', I'd suggest first cleaning up the column: deduplicating 
and ensuring multiple values are separated with pipes ('|'). Only 
deduplicate exact names, e.g., 'Adela' and 'Adela' in record 1. I'm not sure
 what purpose 'Walkers_Transliterated' serves, I don't immediately see any 
entries not already covered in 'Walkers_Original' - can you shed any light 
on it's purpose or origin? Let's investigate these initial issues first, 
then make a plan for consolidating names in attribution.csv and writing a 
new column to that spreadsheet called 'Walkers_Standardised' with the 
standardised names. Does that make sense? Do you have any suggestions? 

● Good plan! Let me investigate the current state of the walker columns and
  the name-mapping document to understand what we're working with.

● Bash(cd /media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-
      WD-2020-04/trap-extraction && python3 -c "
      import csv…)

      import csv…)

● Now I have a clear picture. Let me summarise my findings and ask some
  clarifying questions:

  ---
  Investigation Findings

  Walkers_Original column issues:

  1. Mixed separators: 59 records have mixed pipe/comma separators, 202 use
  pipes only
  2. Exact duplicates: 30 records have duplicate names - typically the
  Leader appears twice (once as the first entry, once in the walker list)
  3. OCR/transcription errors: Names like Adela Sobstkova, Georgi Nehmzov,
  various initials that need mapping

  Walkers_Transliterated column:

  The analysis reveals this column was intended for Bulgarian Cyrillic→Latin
   transliteration but has become inconsistent:
  - 146 records (54%): Identical to Walkers_Original (no transliteration
  needed)
  - 60 records (22%): Contains only the Leader name (partial/legacy
  extraction artefact)
  - 62 records (24%): Minor variations (e.g., surnames stripped, some
  transliteration)

  It appears to be a legacy working column that served its purpose during
  extraction but is now redundant. The transliterated names have already
  been incorporated into Walkers_Original where needed.

  Name-mapping.csv

  Contains 283 entries mapping extracted names → canonical names from
  TRAP-Participants.csv (104 people). Statuses include: mapped, corrected,
  confident, invalid, uncertain.

● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Should we delete the Walkers_Transliterated column since it appears 
     to be a legacy working column that's now redundant? → So long as the 
     name(s) in Walkers_Transliterated are present in Walkers_Original, it 
     can be deleted. If there are any records where Walkers_Transliterated 
     contains new or additional information NOT in Walkers_Original, those 
     new names should be copied to Walkers_Original first, and a list of 
     such instances should be provided to me.
     · The 30 duplicate entries are the Leader appearing twice (e.g., 'Adela
      | Bryan, Simon, Magda, Adela, Vera'). Should we remove the Leader from
      the walker list since they have their own column? → The leader should 
     appear *once* in the walker list - I want the walker list to be 
     inclusive of the leader, with the leader also named in his/her own 
     column.
     · For Walkers_Standardised, what name format should we use? → Full name
      (First Last)

● Let me check if Walkers_Transliterated contains any names not already in
  Walkers_Original:

● Bash(python3 -c "
      import csv…)
  ⎿  Records with unique names in Walkers_Transliterated: 63

     Details:
     … +76 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● That's a false positive - "Petra" is just a shortened form of "Petra
  Tušlová" that's already in Original. Let me do a smarter check for
  genuinely unique names:

● Bash(python3 -c "
      import csv…)
  ⎿  Records with genuinely unique names in Walkers_Transliterated: 29

     Details:
     … +167 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Excellent discovery! The Walkers_Transliterated column does contain 
  valuable data - specifically Latin transliterations of Bulgarian Cyrillic
  names from the 2011 autumn season. For example:
  - Н. Кечева → N. Kecheva
  - Ю. Димитрова → Yu. Dimitrova
  - ЮЦ → YuTs (Cyrillic initials → Latin)

  These 29 records have Cyrillic in Original and Latin in Transliterated -
  we need to merge these before deleting the column.

  Let me now write up the implementation plan:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/distributed-seeking-emerson.md

● I've created the plan. Before proceeding, I need to resolve one
  discrepancy I found:
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · For 2010-03-24 Team D, there's a Vera/Petra discrepancy between 
     columns. Original has 'Vera' but Transliterated has 'Petra'. Which is 
     correct, or should I check the source diary? → From diary: Б. Лилова, 
     Н. Кечева, Л. Марковски, Виера, Виктория plus I confirm I can se Vera 
     in the scanned daily summary sheet, which is hard to read.

● Good - confirmed that Vera is correct (Bulgarian "Виера"). The "Petra" in
  Walkers_Transliterated was an error. Let me update the plan to reflect
  this:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/distributed-seeking-emerson.md

● The plan is complete with all questions resolved. Here's a summary:

  ---
  Plan Summary

  Three phases:

  1. Clean Walkers_Original
    - Merge 28 Latin transliterations from Cyrillic (2011 autumn records)
    - Skip 2010-03-24 Team D (Vera is correct, Petra was error)
    - Normalise all separators to pipes
    - Deduplicate exact names (keep Leader once in walker list)
  2. Delete Walkers_Transliterated - after merging unique content
  3. Create Walkers_Standardised - map names to "First Last" canonical
  format using:
    - TRAP-Participants.csv (104 people)
    - name-mapping.csv (283 mappings)

  Outputs:
  - Updated attribution.csv
  - Report listing merged transliterations and unmapped names
  - New script: scripts/standardise-walkers.py

> can you please check if there are any names in attributes.csv that are NOT
 in the name-mapping document? They should all be covered, but if not, I'd 
like to resolve ambiguities / omissions first, before we undertake renaming.
 

● Good idea - let me check for any names in attribution.csv that aren't
  covered by the name-mapping document:

● Bash(python3 -c "
      import csv…)
  ⎿  Total unique names in Walkers_Original: 240        
     Names in name-mapping.csv: 283
     Names in TRAP-Participants.csv: 402 (various forms)
     … +54 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Found 24 unmapped names. Let me categorise them:

  | Category                      | Names
                                    | Likely Mapping

  Questions:
  1. Leonid (2010-03-30 Team D) - is this a real participant or OCR error?
  2. Sharon. (2011-11-02 Team D) - typo for Shawn?
  3. Should I add all these to the name-mapping document before proceeding
  with standardisation?

> (1) here are the names from the diary for 2010-03039: Г. Нехризов, Н. 
Кечева, Л. Марковски, Виктория, Линдзи\
(2) here are the names from the diary for 2011-11-02: Цони Цонев, Анани 
Антонов, Оскар, Шарон.\
\
You can find the canonical names list in inputs/TRAP-Participants.csv\
\
Please add all missing original names and their mappings to the name-mapping
 document, it should represent a comprehensive record of name changes\
\
In instances like 'Dr Ross training Royce Lawrence' please extract both 
'Shawn Ross' and 'Royce Lawrence' and otherwise split combined entries. \
\
Please let me know if you have any further questions or if I can help with 
other disambiguations 

● Thank you for the clarifications! That resolves the unknowns:

  - Leonid → was OCR error for Линдзи = Prazak Lindsay
  - Sharon. → Bulgarian transliteration Шарон = Shawn Ross
  - Victoria → Viktorie Chystyaková
  - Oskar → Oscar Warren

  Let me update the plan to add a pre-requisite phase for updating the
  name-mapping document:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/distributed-seeking-emerson.md

● I've updated the plan to include Phase 0 with all 24 missing name
  mappings. The plan now has four phases:

  1. Phase 0: Add 24 missing names to name-mapping.csv
  2. Phase 1: Clean Walkers_Original (merge transliterations, normalise
  separators, deduplicate)
  3. Phase 2: Delete Walkers_Transliterated column
  4. Phase 3: Create Walkers_Standardised with canonical "First Last" names

  One note on Silvia Ivanova - she's flagged in follow-up-actions.md as "NOT
   in participant list" and needs to be verified/added. Should I:
  - Add her to TRAP-Participants.csv as part of this work, or
  - Keep her as-is in name-mapping and flag for later participant list
  update?
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Silvia Ivanova appears in 2009 spring Team E data but isn't in 
     TRAP-Participants.csv. How should we handle her? → If you look at 
     planning/follow-up-actions.md, you'll see we need to add her to the 
     participant list, she's a legitimate participant, it's an error in the 
     'canonical' document


● Understood - Silvia Ivanova is a legitimate participant who needs to be
  added to TRAP-Participants.csv. Let me update the plan:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/distributed-seeking-emerson.md

● The plan is now complete. Summary of what we'll do:

  Phase 0: Pre-requisites
  - Add 24 missing name mappings to name-mapping.csv
  - Add Silvia Ivanova to TRAP-Participants.csv

  Phase 1: Clean Walkers_Original
  - Merge 28 Latin transliterations from Cyrillic (2011 autumn)
  - Normalise all separators to pipes
  - Deduplicate exact names (keep Leader once)

  Phase 2: Delete Walkers_Transliterated column

  Phase 3: Create Walkers_Standardised column
  - Map all names to canonical "First Last" format

  Ready to proceed with implementation?

> I believe you mapped 'Sharon' (BG) to 'Shawn Ross' - that *may* be OK, but
 can you search the diaries to see if there are other instances of 'Sharon'?
 I don't see a 'Sharon' on the TRAP-Participants list, but we have found 
three other omissions, so it's not impossible. 

● Good catch - let me search for "Sharon" across the diaries to verify:

● Bash(cd /media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-
      WD-2020-04 && grep -r -i "sharon" --include="*.doc" --include="*.docx"

      Kazanluk/ Elhovo\…)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Grep can't search binary .doc files directly. Let me extract and search
  the relevant diary:

● Bash(antiword "Kazanluk/2011-11-30/Project Records/Team D/D_2011Diary_BG.doc"
      2>/dev/null | grep -i -C3 "шарон\|sharon")

● Found it - Шарон appears once in Team D 2011 diary. Let me search more
  broadly to see how "Shawn" is typically written:

  shows Шарон (with trailing period). Let me check what team Shawn Ross was
  leading that day:

● This is revealing. On 2011-11-02:
  - Team C: Led by Shawn R with walkers including Shawn himself
  - Team D: Led by AA with walkers including Sharon.

  So Shawn Ross was leading his own Team C that day - he wasn't on Team D.
  The Шарон in Team D's Bulgarian diary could be:

  1. A separate person named Sharon (not in participant list)
  2. A diary error/misspelling
  3. Someone who joined just for that day

  Also notable: Bulgarian transliteration of "Shawn" would typically be Шон,
   not Шарон. The spelling Шарон is closer to the female name "Sharon".

  Given this appears only once and Shawn was on a different team that day,
  I'd mark this as uncertain rather than mapping to Shawn Ross. Should I:
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · On 2011-11-02, 'Sharon.' appears on Team D while Shawn Ross was 
     leading Team C. How should we handle this? → I'm missing a daily 
     summary sheet for that day - does 'sharon' appear in any diaries from 
     any other days?

● Summary of findings:

  Шарон / Sharon.:
  - Appears exactly once across all TRAP diaries (only 2011-11-02 Team D)
  - In English diaries, Shawn is consistently written as "Shawn" or "Shawn
  Ross"
  - Team D 2011 Bulgarian diary has NO other references to Shawn/Шон/Ross
  - On that day, Shawn Ross was leading his own Team C (verified in
  attribution.csv)

  Conclusion: This is ambiguous. It could be:
  1. A Bulgarian diary author's unusual rendering of "Shawn" (helping Team D
   for part of that day)
  2. An unidentified person who joined for just one day

  Given the evidence, I'd recommend marking this as uncertain in the
  name-mapping until you can verify. Should I update the plan to mark
  Sharon. as uncertain rather than mapping to Shawn Ross?

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/distributed-seeking-emerson.md

● I've updated the plan to mark Sharon. as uncertain rather than mapping to
  Shawn Ross.

  Updated counts:
  - 23 name mappings with confident/corrected status
  - 1 uncertain (Sharon.)
  - 1 invalid ([unclear])

  The plan is now ready. Any other names you'd like me to investigate before
   we proceed, or shall I exit plan mode so we can start implementation?

> Yes, do not map to Shawn (I'm Shawn, I don't remember helping a BG team 
that day, and Bulgarians didn't transliterate my name that way, as you 
observed). Instead keep as 'Sharon' (it's clearly written in the diary) and 
add investigation of 'sharon' to 'follow-up-actions.md'.\

We are low on context, please update your plan and write it out to a MD doc 
in planning/ so that we can execute it in the next session. After you have 
done that, compose a /compact message.
