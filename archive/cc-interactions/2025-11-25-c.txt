> /compact   Session Summary - 25 November 2025 (Name Standardisation Execution)

  Completed: Walker Name Standardisation

  Successfully executed the name standardisation plan for attribution.csv:

  Phase 0 - Pre-requisites:
  - Added 50 new entries to outputs/name-mapping.csv (now 679 total)
  - Added Silvia Ivanova to inputs/TRAP-Participants.csv (now 105 participants)
  - Added Sharon and Yavor L investigations to planning/follow-up-actions.md

  Phase 1 - Clean Walkers_Original:
  - Merged 28 Cyrillic→Latin transliterations (2011 autumn Teams A & D)
  - Normalised 59 records with mixed pipe/comma separators
  - Deduplicated 30 records with exact duplicate names
  - Exception: Kept "Vera" for 2010-03-24 Team D (Petra was error)

  Phase 2: Removed Walkers_Transliterated column

  Phase 3: Created Walkers_Standardised column with canonical "First Last" names

  Results: Only 1 unmapped name remains: Lizzy (Czech volunteer, identity being 
researched)

  Files created:
  - scripts/standardise-walkers.py - Reusable standardisation script
  - outputs/walker-standardisation-report.md
  - planning/name-standardisation-plan.md (marked COMPLETE)
  - archive/backups/attribution.csv.backup_pre-standardisation_20251125

  Commits pushed:
  - 78e125f docs: add session transcript
  - ebda43b feat(walkers): standardise walker names

  Next Task: Leader and Role Column Standardisation

  Apply same name standardisation to:
  1. Leader column
  2. Role columns: PDA_Operator, Paper_Recorder, Data_Editor, GPS_Operator, 
Photographer, Author

  Key differences from walker standardisation:
  - Don't keep original versions - replace directly with canonical names
  - Multiple leaders use pipe (|) separators
  - Add mapping: Baba → Bara → Bara Weissová

  Approach: Modify scripts/standardise-walkers.py or create new script to 
process these columns using the existing
  679-entry name mapping.

> Hi CC, welcome back! Are you ready to plan leader and role name 
standardisation? As before, please ask any questions you need to. 

● Yes, I'm ready to plan the leader and role name standardisation. Let me
  first read the existing plan file and explore the current state of the
  data.

● Reading Plan(~/.claude/plans/distributed-seeking-emerson.md)
  ⎿  Read 275 lines

● Read(outputs/attribution.csv)
  ⎿  Error: File content (35266 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). 
     Please use offset and limit parameters to read specific portions of the 
     file, or use the GrepTool to search for specific content.

● Let me read a sample of the attribution.csv to understand the current
  column structure:

● Read(outputs/attribution.csv)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

● Search(pattern: "Baba", path: "outputs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "Leader", path: "outputs/attribution.csv", output_mode:
        "content")
  ⎿  Found 5 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good - I can see the structure. Let me launch explore agents to understand
   the variety of values in the Leader and Role columns:

● 3 Explore agents finished (ctrl+o to expand)
   ├─ Explore Leader column values · 23 tool uses · 57.2k tokens
   │  ⎿ Done
   ├─ Explore Role column values · 11 tool uses · 50.9k tokens
   │  ⎿ Done
   └─ Review existing standardisation script · 20 tool uses · 46.2k tokens
      ⎿ Done

● Excellent - I now have comprehensive information from the exploration. Let
   me ask some clarifying questions before finalising the plan:
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Should metadata entries in role columns (Paper_Recorder has 'Images',
      'Track Log', 'Diary') be removed, kept as-is, or flagged as UNMAPPED? 
     → Role columns should *only* contain names. If they contain *valuable* 
     metadata, please move it to a note. Otherwise, delete it (the examples 
     you provided do not add value).
     · The Data_Editor column has unclear abbreviations ('As', 'Hm', 'No', 
     'Note'). How should these be handled? → Map where possible, noting that
      these columns contain some superfluous words - check against the 
     walker list to see if the abbreviation could reasonably represent one 
     of the walkers - all roles *should* be filled by walkers. Present 
     ambiguous cases to me.
     · Should I create a new script or extend the existing 
     standardise-walkers.py to handle Leader and Role columns? → What do you
      suggest? I'm inclinded towards a general script, but is it worth the 
     effort? Note we also need to do 'Author' if that's not currently in 
     this plan.

● Good questions. Regarding the script approach:

  My recommendation: New script (standardise-leaders-roles.py)

  Rationale:
  1. Walker standardisation is complete and tested - we don't want to risk
  breaking it
  2. Different logic needed: Walkers are pipe-separated lists; Leaders are
  single values or comma-pairs; Roles are single values with occasional
  pipes
  3. Shared lookup: Both scripts can use the same name-mapping.csv and
  TRAP-Participants.csv
  4. A general script would be overkill for just two standardisation tasks

  Author is definitely in scope - it's the most populated role column
  (217/268 records, 65 unique values). The role columns I'm planning to
  standardise are:
  - Leader
  - PDA_Operator
  - Paper_Recorder
  - Data_Editor
  - GPS_Operator
  - Photographer
  - Author

  Before I write the plan, let me identify the ambiguous Data_Editor cases
  and check a few other things:

● Search(pattern: "Data_Editor", path: "outputs/attribution.csv", output_mode:
        "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: ",As,|,Hm,|,No,|,Note,", path: "outputs/attribution.csv",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good, I can see the Data_Editor cases clearly now. Let me present the
  ambiguous cases for your decision:
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Data_Editor 'Hm' (2010-04-09 Team B): Walkers were Adela, Petra 
     Tušlová, Peter. 'Hm' doesn't match any walker. Could be Hamish (not on 
     team that day) or OCR error. What should we do? → Walkers that day 
     were: Adela, Dasha, Pesho, Stana (confirmed in diary and daily progress
      form). 'Hm' is an OCR artefact, but I'm concerned about the apparent 
     error in walkers.

     · Data_Editor 'Note' and 'No' appear to be placeholders meaning 'no 
     data editor' rather than names. Should I clear these entries? → Clear 
     them

● Good catch on the walker discrepancy - that's a separate data quality
  issue. I'll add it to follow-up-actions.md and clear "Hm" as an OCR
  artefact.

  Now I have all the information I need. Let me write the plan:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/distributed-seeking-emerson.md

● I've drafted the plan. Before finalising, I have a few uncertain cases to
  clarify:

● Search(pattern: "Barbora Klánová|Barbara Kl", path: "outputs/attribution.csv",
         output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 10 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "P\.H\.|Vitaha", path: "outputs/attribution.csv", output_mode:
         "content")
  ⎿  Found 3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good - I can see the context now:

  1. Barbora Klánová (Author, 2009-03-25 Team D) - This is clearly an OCR
  variant of "Barbara Klara Olujic" since B.O. was a walker that day. I'll
  update the mapping.
  2. P.H. (Author, 2010-03-20 & 21 Team C) - Walkers were Elena, Bistra,
  Bara, Jana, Sonja. None have initials P.H. Genuinely uncertain.
  3. Vitaha (Author, 2010-03-27 Team B) - On a non-fieldwork day (base
  cleanup). Could be a typo for Viktorie?
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Author 'P.H.' appears on 2010-03-20 and 2010-03-21 (Team C under 
     Bara). Walkers were Elena, Bistra, Bara, Jana, Sonja - none have 
     initials P.H. Do you recognise this person? → From the diary I have: 
     Екип: Елена, Бистра, Барбара, Яна, Соня (2010-03-20) and Екип: Елена, 
     Бистра, Бара, Соня, Яна (2010-03-21). From the scanned summary shets I 
     have what looks lik 'SH' rather than 'PH', and the maes seem to be 
     Bara, Elena, Jana, Sonja(?), and Bistra. Does that help?
      

     · Author 'Vitaha' appears on 2010-03-27 (non-fieldwork day - base 
     cleanup). Could this be Viktorie or another name? → Which team and I'll
      look it up?

● That's helpful! If it's "SH" rather than "P.H.", that would be Sona 
  Holičková (SH initials) - she's listed as "Sonja" in the walker list for
  those days. I'll map "SH" → Sona Holičková and also "P.H." → Sona
  Holičková (as a likely OCR error for SH).

  For Vitaha - it's 2010-03-27 Team B under leader Adela. The extraction
  notes say "Base cleanup and moving day - no fieldwork".
                                                                         
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · For 'P.H.' (likely 'SH' per your check) - should I map it to Sona 
     Holičková? → Yes, map to Sona

● Did you have a chance to check on Vitaha (2010-03-27 Team B, base
  cleanup/moving day)? Once I have that answer, I can finalise the plan.

> I can't find a source for it for 2010-03-27, as there are no scanned 
forms, I'm not sure how a misspelled name could have been introduced, I 
think it's an error - since this is a non-fieldwork day, it doesn't matter, 
and I would just emilinate it, as I don't see that Viktoria was usually on 
this team. 

● Understood - I'll mark Vitaha as invalid and clear it. Let me update the
  plan with all our clarifications:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/distributed-seeking-emerson.md

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/distributed-seeking-emerson.md

● The plan is now complete with all clarifications resolved. Here's a
  summary:

  Plan Summary:
  - New script: scripts/standardise-leaders-roles.py
  - Columns to standardise: Leader + 6 role columns (PDA_Operator,
  Paper_Recorder, Data_Editor, GPS_Operator, Photographer, Author)
  - ~40 new name mappings to add to name-mapping.csv
  - Key decisions:
    - Replace values directly (no "_Original" preservation)
    - Multiple leaders use pipe separators
    - Clear metadata entries (Images, Track Log, Diary)
    - Clear placeholders (No, Note, Hm, Vitaha)
    - P.H. → Sona Holičková (OCR error for SH)
    - Add 2010-04-09 walker discrepancy to follow-up-actions.md
