  Session Summary

  Completed Work:

  1. Petra Disambiguation ✅ (commits e11eb04, dd9ad8f)
    - Automated disambiguation: 43/48 records
    - Manual review: 5 remaining records resolved
    - Final result: Petra Janouchová (7 records), Petra Tušlová (43 records)
    - 1 extraction error corrected (Petra → Vera)
  2. Name-Mapping pdf_sources QA ✅ (commit eab8767)
    - Verified all 275 pdf_sources references
    - Fixed 32 erroneous entries (diary filename inconsistencies)
    - 0 errors remaining

  Current Status:
  - You've completed manual review of name-mapping and resolved most
  ambiguous names
  - You mentioned "name-mapping.md has been updated" - I'll check for this
  file and the current state of name-mapping.csv

  Let me read the updated name-mapping file to see what work remains:

● Bash(ls -la outputs/name-mapping* 2>/dev/null | head -10)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(git status --short | grep -i "name-mapping")
  ⎿   M claude_extraction/outputs/name-mapping.csv

● Perfect - I can see name-mapping.csv has been modified. Let me read it to
  see the current state and identify what work remains:

● Read(outputs/name-mapping.csv)
  ⎿  Read 284 lines

● Perfect! I can see the updated name-mapping.csv. You've made excellent
  progress - I can see you've added:

  1. New corrected_name column - showing what the extracted name should
  actually be
  2. New Links column - with file paths for some entries
  3. Significant manual corrections - You've filled in corrected_name and
  canonical_name for most of the 66 review_needed entries (rows 2-67)

  Current State

  Review needed entries: 66 entries (rows 2-67)
  - Most now have corrected_name and canonical_name filled in
  - Many have detailed notes about the corrections

  Already resolved: 218 entries
  - 126 mapped
  - 1 disambiguated (Petra)
  - 6 confirmed
  - 85 confident

  What Work Remains?

  Looking at the review_needed entries, most appear to have corrections
  identified. The next logical steps would be:

  1. Apply the corrections from corrected_name to attribution.csv
  2. Update status from review_needed to confirmed or mapped
  3. Verify the corrections are accurate

  Ready to proceed? Just let me know what you'd like me to do with these
  corrections - should I:
  - Create a script to apply all the corrections to attribution.csv?
  - Review specific entries first?
  - Something else?

> Yes, please proceed through those steps. You'll notice that a few of the 
entries could not be resolved, instead containing statements like 'None, OCR
 false positive' in the 'corrected_name' column. Perhaps (a) change status 
to 'irrecoverable' or something like that (you choose a good term), add the 
statement (e.g., 'None, OCR false positive') to 'notes', then (b) apply the 
remaining 'true' corrections to attribution.csv, then (c) verify the 
corrections are accurate. Does that sound good? It's a major action, so 
let's produce a proper plan - ask any necessary questions first then 
formulate. 

● I need to ask some clarifying questions before I can formulate a
  comprehensive plan:
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · For entries marked 'None, OCR false positive' in corrected_name, what
      should happen to those records in attribution.csv? → Replace with 
     empty/null

     · When both corrected_name and canonical_name exist, which should be 
     written to attribution.csv? → Use canonical_name
     · What status should entries get in name-mapping.csv after successfully
      applying corrections? → corrected
     · What status term should replace 'review_needed' for irrecoverable OCR
      errors and invalid entries? → invalid

● Perfect! Now let me research the full scope of this work to create a
  comprehensive plan.

● Plan(Analyze correction scope)
  ⎿  Done (20 tool uses · 80.6k tokens · 3m 25s)

  ⎿  Apply Name Corrections from name-mapping.csv to attribution.csv

     Overview

     Apply 66 manual corrections from your reviewed name-mapping.csv to 
     attribution.csv, handling valid corrections, invalid OCR entries, and 
     uncertain identities.

     Scope

     - 66 entries with status='review_needed' to process
     - 58 valid corrections → Apply canonical_name to attribution.csv
     - 6 invalid entries → Clear from attribution.csv, mark as 'invalid'
     - 2 uncertain entries (Lizzy/Lisi) → Apply corrected_name with note

     Phase 1: Prepare Correction Script

     Create scripts/apply_name_corrections.py that will:

     1. Read both files
       - Load name-mapping.csv (corrections)
       - Load attribution.csv (target data)
     2. Categorize review_needed entries
       - Valid: Has canonical_name → use it for replacement
       - Invalid: corrected_name contains 'None', 'OCR false positive', 
     'Illegible', 'Unknown'
       - Uncertain: Has corrected_name but no canonical_name (Lizzy/Lisi)
     3. Apply corrections with careful string handling
       - Match by Date + Team from name-mapping to attribution
       - Search these columns: Leader, Walkers_Original, 
     Walkers_Transliterated, Author, PDA_Operator, Paper_Recorder, 
     GPS_Operator, Data_Editor, Photographer
       - Use exact name matching (case-insensitive) to avoid partial matches
       - Preserve delimiters: Handle both pipe-separated ("|") and 
     comma-separated (",") lists
       - Replace extracted_name with canonical_name (or empty string for 
     invalid entries)
     4. Update name-mapping.csv status
       - Valid corrections → status='corrected'
       - Invalid entries → status='invalid', move invalid marker to notes
       - Uncertain → status='uncertain', note identity not confirmed

     Phase 2: Execute Corrections

     Run the script with detailed logging:
     - Report each correction made
     - Count records affected per entry
     - Flag any entries that couldn't be matched
     - Track columns modified

     Phase 3: Verification

     Create verification report showing:

     1. Sample verification (10 random corrections)
       - Before: extracted_name
       - After: canonical_name
       - Dates/teams/sources
     2. Statistics
       - Total records modified in attribution.csv
       - Breakdown by correction type (valid/invalid/uncertain)
       - Column-by-column impact
     3. Edge cases review
       - Multi-name strings properly handled
       - Delimiters preserved
       - No unintended replacements

     Phase 4: Documentation

     Create outputs/name-corrections-report.md documenting:
     - All 66 corrections applied
     - Invalid entries identified
     - Uncertain identities noted
     - Before/after samples
     - Methodology

     Phase 5: Commit

     Git commit with message:
     feat(names): Apply 66 manual name corrections from review

     - Applied 58 valid corrections to attribution.csv
     - Marked 6 OCR false positives as invalid
     - Noted 2 uncertain identity entries (Lizzy/Lisi)
     - Updated 60-80 attribution records
     - Standardized names to canonical forms

     🤖 Generated with Claude Code
     Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>

     Special Handling

     Invalid entries (6):
     - H., Hun, M, P, X [leader], Olga → Clear from attribution.csv
     - Status → 'invalid'
     - Notes → "OCR false positive" or similar

     Uncertain entries (2):
     - Lizzy/Lisi → Apply "Lizzy" (more correct than "Lisi")
     - Status → 'uncertain'
     - Notes → "Czech volunteer, full name unknown"

     String replacement logic:
     - "Bryan, Magda, Adela, Tracy, Martin" → "Bryan, Magda, Adela, Vera 
     Doležálková, Martin"
     - "Halyar | Knacfl | Serena" → "Matyáš Kracík | Matyáš Kracík | Tereza 
     Blažková"

     Safeguards

     - Backup attribution.csv before modifications
     - Exact match only (no substring replacement)
     - Preserve all delimiters and formatting
     - Verify record count unchanged (269 records)
     - Log all changes for audit trail

  entries had no matches:

     … +17 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I see - "Lizzy" wasn't replaced because the corrected_name is also "Lizzy"
   (no change needed). Let me check a few of the other unmatched entries to
  understand the pattern:

  Commit

  Commit c8833e4: "feat(names): Apply 66 manual name corrections from
  review"

  All changes committed and documented. The name-corrections-report.md
  provides full details of every correction made!

> ok, one minor error, 'LIzzy' was a typo, it should have been 'Lisi' > 
'Lizzy'. Also, the entries that were 'Lizzi' are the same person. This is s 
real person, we're searching for her full name now. 

● I'll fix that typo right away. Let me correct "LIzzy" to "Lizzy" in
  attribution.csv and update the name-mapping to reflect that this is a real
   person whose full name you're researching.

  - 2009-11-10 Team B: LIzzy → Lizzy
  - 2009-11-14 Team C: Lisi → Lizzy

  name-mapping.csv:
  1. Lisi entry - Fixed typo and updated:
    - corrected_name: LIzzy → Lizzy
    - team: B → B, C (appeared on both teams)
    - notes: "Same person as Lizzy. Czech volunteer, full name being
  researched."
  2. Lizzy entry - Updated notes:
    - Old: "Identity not confirmed. Lizzy' is a Czech volunteer, name
  unknown..."
    - New: "Czech volunteer, full name being researched. See image link next
   column."

  Verification

  - ✅ 0 occurrences of "LIzzy" (typo eliminated)
  - ✅ 0 occurrences of "Lisi" (all corrected to Lizzy)
  - ✅ 5 total "Lizzy" occurrences across 2009-11-09 to 2009-11-14
  - ✅ All variants (Lisi/Lizzy/Lizzi) documented as same person

  Commit

  Commit 94bb51f: "fix(names): Correct 'LIzzy' typo to 'Lizzy' and update
  research status"

  The data now correctly reflects that Lizzy is a real Czech volunteer whose
   full name you're researching!

> Ok, is there anything else you know of that we need to do before moving to
 a final QA phase? 

● Good question! Let me review what might still need attention before final
  QA:

● Bash(python3 << 'EOF'
      import csv…)
  ⎿  NAME-MAPPING STATUS SUMMARY                                 
     ============================================================
     … +16 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(outputs/follow-up-actions.md)
  ⎿  Read 115 lines

● I can see several things that should be addressed before final QA:

● Bash(python3 << 'EOF'
      import csv…)
  ⎿ INVESTIGATING UNMATCHED ENTRIES                                        
    =======================================================================
    =========
    … +22 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


● Based on my investigation, here's what needs to be addressed before final
  QA:

  Outstanding Items

  1. Update follow-up-actions.md ⚠️

  The file is outdated:
  - Still says "59 entries marked review_needed" (actually 0 now)
  - Lists old sample entries we've already resolved
  - Has a note about "Add: Jiří Musil Spring 2010 Kazanlak"

  2. Investigate "unmatched" entries ℹ️

  Most (8 of 10) were already corrected in previous processing. Two might
  need checking:
  - Caleb (2010-03-22 Team B) - mapped to "Adela Sobotkova" but not found in
   record
  - Nadege (2010-03-22 Team B) - mapped to "Martin Mladenov" but not found
  in record

  These could be:
  - Data entry errors in name-mapping.csv
  - Names that were corrected even earlier
  - OCR errors that were never in the data

  3. Silvia Ivanova ℹ️

  Still pending verification - appears in Team E 2009 diary but not in
  participant list

  4. Jiří Musil note ℹ️

  Bottom of follow-up-actions.md says "Add: Jiří Musil Spring 2010 Kazanlak"
   - need to check if this was addressed

  My recommendation: Let me:
  1. Check if Jiří Musil is in the participant list
  2. Investigate the Caleb/Nadege entries
  3. Update follow-up-actions.md with current status
  4. Create a pre-QA checklist

  Would you like me to proceed with these checks?

> please undertake #1 and then we'll go from there. One thing to also 
consider is a disambiguation run for 'Adela' - Adela Sobotkova was one of 
the project leaders and appears everywere, but Adela Dorňáková is a 
different person and attended one season (autumn 2010); we should make sure 
that Dorňáková is listed where she needs to be.

       33 +  
       34 +  **Status:** Pending investigation
       35 +  
       36 +  **Context:** Two different people named Adela participated 
          + in TRAP:
       37 +  - **Adela Sobotkova** - Project leader, attended multiple 
          + seasons (2009-2011)
       38 +  - **Adela Dorňáková** - Field walker, attended 2010-autumn 
          + only
       39 +  
       40 +  **Issue:** Generic "Adela" entries in attribution.csv need 
          + to be verified to ensure Adela Dorňáková is correctly 
          + identified where she participated (2010-autumn), and not 
          + confused with Adela Sobotkova.
       41 +  
       42 +  **Action required:**
       43 +  - [ ] Search attribution.csv for all "Adela" entries in 
          + 2010-autumn
       44 +  - [ ] Cross-reference with team compositions and dates
       45 +  - [ ] Verify Dorňáková is correctly identified in her season
       46 +  - [ ] Update any ambiguous "Adela" entries with full names
       47 +  
       48 +  **Expected impact:** 2010-autumn records (October-November 
          + 2010)

  Adela Disambiguation Investigation Results

  Participant Status

  - Adela Sobotkova: Investigator/Project leader, attended 2009-2011
  (including 2010-autumn)
  - Adéla Dorňáková: Field walker/Student, attended 2010-autumn ONLY

  2010-Autumn Analysis (5 records)

  | Date       | Status       | Details
                      |
  |------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------
  --------------------|
  | 2010-10-22 | ✅ Clear      | Both explicitly named: "Adela Sobotkova"
  AND "Adela Dorňáková"  |
  | 2010-10-23 | ✅ Clear      | Initials used: "AD" (Dorňáková, team
  leader) + "AS" (Sobotkova) |
  | 2010-10-24 | ✅ Clear      | Initials used: "AD" (Dorňáková, team
  leader) + "AS" (Sobotkova) |
  | 2010-11-02 | ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS | Generic "Adela" - needs verification
                      |
  | 2010-11-03 | ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS | Generic "Adela" - needs verification
                      |

  Key Observations

  Oct 22-24 (Day_03.pdf):
  - Adela D (Dorňáková) was team leader
  - Both Adelas clearly present

  Nov 2-3 (Day_05.pdf):
  - Petra T is team leader (NOT Adela)
  - Only generic "Adela" in walker list
  - Likely Sobotkova (long-term investigator), but needs PDF verification

  Recommendation

  You should review Day_05.pdf for Nov 2-3 to confirm which Adela is
  present. Based on the pattern:
  - Dorňáková appears to have been there for early days (Oct 22-24) as team
  leader
  - Sobotkova was there throughout the season
  - Generic "Adela" on Nov 2-3 most likely = Sobotkova

  Should I create a disambiguation script similar to what we did for Petra,
  or would you prefer to verify the PDFs first?

> we are almost out of context and need to /compact - can you write a 
compact message so that we can resume these actions in the next session? 
While you are compacting I will review Day_05.pdf.

  4. Adela Disambiguation Investigation 🔄

  Issue: Two people named Adela in 2010-autumn:
  - Adela Sobotkova - Project leader, attended 2009-2011
  - Adéla Dorňáková - Field walker, attended 2010-autumn ONLY

  2010-autumn Analysis (5 records):

  | Date       | Status       | Source     | Details
                     |
  |------------|--------------|------------|--------------------------------
  -------------------|
  | 2010-10-22 | ✅ Clear      | Day_03.pdf | Both named: "Adela Sobotkova"
  + "Adela Dorňáková" |
  | 2010-10-23 | ✅ Clear      | Day_03.pdf | AD (Dorňáková leader) + AS
  (Sobotkova)            |
  | 2010-10-24 | ✅ Clear      | Day_03.pdf | AD (Dorňáková leader) + AS
  (Sobotkova)            |
  | 2010-11-02 | ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS | Day_05.pdf | Generic "Adela" - likely
  Sobotkova                |
  | 2010-11-03 | ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS | Day_05.pdf | Generic "Adela" - likely
  Sobotkova                |

  Pattern observed:
  - Dorňáková was team leader early days (Oct 22-24)
  - Petra T became leader on Nov 2-3
  - Generic "Adela" on Nov 2-3 most likely = Sobotkova

  Pending: User reviewing Day_05.pdf to confirm which Adela on Nov 2-3

  Outstanding Research Items

  1. Lizzy (Czech volunteer, 2009-autumn) - Full name being researched
  2. Silvia Ivanova - Appears in Team E 2009 diary, NOT in participant list
  - needs verification
  3. Jiří Musil - Note says "Add: Spring 2010 Kazanlak" - check if needs
  adding to participant list
  4. Adela Nov 2-3 - Awaiting PDF review to confirm Sobotkova vs Dorňáková

  ---
  Next Steps

  1. Complete Adela disambiguation based on PDF review
  2. Create disambiguation script if needed (similar to Petra script)
  3. Pre-QA checklist - verify data integrity before final QA
  4. Investigate Jiří Musil and Silvia Ivanova participant list issues
