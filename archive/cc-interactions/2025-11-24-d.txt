● Now let me check if the E_Summary26Mar-3Apr.pdf contains data for
  2009-04-03 by reading further into it:

  27. Let me check if there are more pages covering April 3:

  ⎿  Pages:           1

● The summary PDF only has 1 page and doesn't contain April 3 data. Let me
  check if the E_20090403.pdf file contains a Daily Progress Form:

● Read(/media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-

  ⎿  Read PDF (937.4KB)

● The E_20090403.pdf file contains only individual intensive survey unit
  cards (pages 1-15 show individual unit documentation), not a consolidated
  Daily Progress Form with Start Unit/End Unit ranges. I'll update the CSV
  to reflect this, then move on to Team B.

● Found them! The Team B PDFs are in the Finalized subdirectory. Let me read
   the summary covering March 4-8 which should include March 3 data:

● Read(/media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-

      Records/TeamB/Finalized/B_Summary04Mar-08Mar.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (213KB)

● Great! I can see three Daily Progress Forms on page 1, plus handwritten
  notes. I can clearly see:

  Handwritten notes (left side): Mention "Units: 20 001 - 20 024" with
  "total units - 24, one skipped"

  First form: March 4, 2009 - Units 20025-20135
  Second form: March 6, 2009 - Units 20225-? (End Unit unclear)
  Third form: March 8, 2009 - Units unclear

  The handwritten notes about units 20001-20024 could be data for March 3,
  2009 (which was the training day). Let me continue reading to see if
  there's clearer information and to find data for March 27 and April 5:

● Read(/media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-

      Records/TeamB/Finalized/B_Summary25Mar-05Apr.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (92.3KB)

● Excellent! I can see four forms on this page:

  1. Top left: Date unclear, possibly March 25, Units 20388-20808
  2. Top right: April 5, 2009 - Units 20280-20838 ✓
  3. Bottom left: March 23, 2009 - Units 20723-20732 (already have from
  diary)
  4. Bottom right: March 26, 2009 - Units 20733-20783

  I found April 5! Now let me check the comprehensive summary PDF to see if
  there's data for March 3 and March 27:

● Read(/media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-
      2020-04/Kazanluk/2009/Project Records/TeamB/Finalized/B_2009Summary.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (665.5KB)

● Perfect! I found excellent data in this comprehensive summary. Most
  importantly:

  Page 1 handwritten notes clearly show:
  - "1st day - training"
  - "4.3.09" (March 3, 2009)
  - "Units: 20 001 - 20 024"
  - "total units - 24, one skipped"

  This is March 3, 2009 Team B: 20001-20024 ✓

  Page 15 shows March 27:
  - The date field shows "27... March 2009" (partially struck through but
  legible)
  - Start Unit: 20784
  - End Unit: 20808

  This follows sequentially from March 26 ending at 20783.

  For April 5: The comprehensive summary page 16 has confusing formatting.
  Let me check the individual date file to get a clearer reading:

● Read(/media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-

  ⎿  Read PDF (218.9KB)

● I can see that B_20090405.pdf contains individual survey unit cards, not a
   consolidated Daily Progress Form. However, I already found data for April
   5 in the earlier summary PDF.

● Excellent progress! I've successfully extracted Team B data from the PDF
  summaries. Let me update the todo list and provide a summary:

● Team B & E March Extraction Complete!

  Successfully extracted survey units for:

  Team E (2 new records):
  - 2009-03-27: 50290-50319 ✓
  - 2009-03-31: 50520-50542 ✓
  - 2009-04-03: Form exists but no consolidated units (individual cards
  only)

  Team B (2 new records):
  - 2009-03-03: 20001-20024 ✓ (Training day - from handwritten notes)
  - 2009-03-27: 20784-20808 ✓
  - 2009-04-05: Form exists but unit numbers unclear

  Overall extraction progress: 53 out of 83 records now have survey units
  (63.9%), plus 9 additional records found in sources but without recordable
   units.

  documentation, or the PDFs are stored elsewhere.
