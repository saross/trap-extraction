> Hi CC, welcome back, can you look at 
archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-24-g.txt and use that to recall what we've 
been working on? VS Code just crashed during /compact and I'd like to resume
 the remaining to-do tasks

● I've reviewed the project status. This is the TRAP Data Extraction project
   for AKB (Archaeological Knowledge Base) submission. Here's where we
  stand:

  Completed

  - ✅ Task 1: Survey unit extraction (89.18% coverage - 239/268 with units,
   28 explained, 1 pending renumbering)
  - ✅ Walker data extraction (100% - 268/268 records)
  - ✅ Name disambiguation (Adela, Petra, etc.)
  - ✅ Date error corrections (2010-03-08, 2011-11-10)

  Remaining Tasks (from akb-submission-todo.md)

  High Priority:
  1. Task 2: Verify team leader for every day (pending verification)
  2. Task 3: Standardise all names to name-mapping document
  3. Task 8: Verify participant name spelling

  Medium Priority:
  4. Task 4: Extract role information via NLP diary analysis (PDA operator,
  paper recorder, etc.)
  5. Task 9: Review and finalise Extraction_Notes

  QA & Submission:
  6. Task 5: Plan and complete QA exercise
  7. Task 7: Create data dictionary
  8. Task 10: Create submission metadata
  9. Task 6: Package for secondary QA (Gemini)

  Also pending (from follow-up-actions.md):
  - Six-digit to five-digit survey unit mapping for 2009-03-12 Team C
  - Participant list updates (Silvia Ivanova, Lizzy, Jiří Musil)

  Which task would you like to resume? The logical next step would be Task 2
   (verify team leaders) followed by Task 3 (name standardisation), as these
   are prerequisites for the QA exercise.

> ok, great. I'd like to move on to verifying the team leader wherever we 
can. This operation will look a lot like the resolution of the missing 
survey unit numbers. The process will involve going through the scanned 
Daily Progress Forms and the 'primary' diaries (see source-inventory.md for 
more information). When we are finished, I will help resolve conflicts, 
amgibuities, and any remaining records with no leader. Please ask any 
clarifying questions you have and develop a plan 

● I'll explore the codebase to understand the current state and source
  structure before developing a plan. Let me launch parallel Explore agents
  to investigate different aspects.

● 3 Explore agents finished (ctrl+o to expand)
   ├─ Analyse leader coverage in attribution.csv · 24 tool uses · 37.3k tokens
   │  ⎿  Done
   ├─ Understand source hierarchy for leaders · 1 tool use · 16.1k tokens
   │  ⎿  Done
   └─ Review extraction methodology and scripts · 14 tool uses · 51.5k tokens
      ⎿  Done

● Excellent! I now have a clear picture of the current state. Let me
  summarise what I found:

  Current Leader Data Status

  | Metric         | Count | Notes                                     |
  |----------------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
  | Total records  | 268   |                                           |
  | With leaders   | 267   | 99.6% populated                           |
  | Missing leader | 1     | 2010-04-06 Team B (non-survey day)        |
  | Initials only  | 28    | NK (10), JD (6), GM (5), GN (3), etc.     |
  | Typos found    | ~5    | "Adela Sobstkova", "Georgi Nehmzov", etc. |
  | Format issues  | 7     | Leading quote marks on "Julia entries     |

  So the task is primarily verification and standardisation rather than
  extraction from scratch. The main work is:
  1. Resolving initials to full names (28 records)
  2. Fixing typos and inconsistencies
  3. Verifying against source documents

  Before I develop detailed plans, I have some clarifying questions:
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What is the target format for leader names in the final output? → For
      now, you can keep as-is, the *next* phase is name standardisation.
     · How should we handle records where the leader cannot be determined 
     from sources? → Keep existing value if present; if genuinely empty, 
     flag for manual review.
     · Should I generate a verification report similar to the survey unit 
     extraction report? → Yes, full report

● Now I understand the scope. Let me launch planning agents to develop the
  approach:

● 2 Plan agents finished (ctrl+o to expand)
   ├─ Plan data-first leader verification · 26 tool uses · 107.4k tokens
   │  ⎿  Done
   └─ Plan source-first leader verification · 34 tool uses · 110.4k tokens
      ⎿  Done

● Excellent! I have two solid perspectives. Let me synthesise and clarify
  one key trade-off with you:

  Key Finding

  Both approaches discovered that name-mapping.csv already contains mappings
   for all 28 initials (NK→Nadezhda Kecheva, JD→Yulia Dimitrova, etc.) and
  the typos. This opens two paths:

  Option A: Apply Existing Mappings (Quick)
  - Directly apply name-mapping.csv to Leader field
  - ~31 records updated in one script run
  - Trusts that previous name-mapping work was correct

  Option B: Full Source Verification (Thorough)
  - Go through Daily Progress PDFs and primary diaries
  - Extract leaders from sources independently
  - Compare against attribution.csv and existing mappings
  - Matches the survey unit extraction workflow you described
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · The name-mapping.csv already has mappings for all leader initials. Do
      you want independent source verification, or is applying existing 
     mappings sufficient? → I want to complete extracing the list of team 
     leaders first, then move on to name mapping / standardisation - we need
      to be careful with that step so as not to introduce errors, and I'd 
     like to take it seprately - right now focus on extraction not renaming


● Ah, that's an important clarification! The task is extraction and 
  verification, NOT name standardisation. We're going through sources to:
  1. Extract/verify the raw leader data
  2. Fill in any genuinely missing leaders
  3. Fix obvious typos only if source clearly shows different value
  4. Leave name standardisation for a separate phase

  Let me write the plan:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/glittery-wondering-spring.md

● I've created the plan at
  /home/shawn/.claude/plans/glittery-wondering-spring.md. Here's a summary:

  Plan Summary: Leader Extraction and Verification

  Scope: Extract and verify leaders from sources - NOT name standardisation
  (that's separate)

  Workflow

  1. Generate investigation runsheet - List all 268 records with source
  files to check
  2. PDF extraction - Read Daily Progress Forms (have explicit "Leader"
  field)
  3. Diary verification - Check primary diaries where PDFs unavailable
  4. Consolidate and compare - Match extractions against attribution.csv
  5. Apply verified updates - Fix genuine errors only (not initials→names)
  6. Generate report - Full documentation with source citations

  Key Decisions

  - PDFs are primary for leaders (explicit field on form)
  - Leave initials as-is (NK, JD, etc.) - document for standardisation phase
  - Process by season/team for efficient batch reading
  - Flag conflicts for your review rather than auto-resolving

  Outputs

  - leader-extraction-pdf.csv - Extracted from PDFs
  - leader-extraction-diary.csv - Extracted from diaries
  - leader-comparison.csv - Comparison with current data
  - leader-verification-report.md - Full report
  - Updated attribution.csv (with backup)

  Does this plan align with what you had in mind? If so, I'll exit plan mode
   and we can begin implementation.

> With only one record empty, I'd like to defer this work until we undertake
 a broader QA / verification pass. Please write out your plan under 
'planning' and we'll use it as the basis of the broader QA pass later. 
Instead, after you've save the leader plan, I'd like you to make a new plan 
using a similar approach to populate the *roles* (pda operator, paper 
records person, etc.). You do not need to verify existing ones in 
attribution.csv, but I want to very methodically review available sources to
 populate as many leader roles as possible. In this, the diaries, including 
secondary and supplemental diaries, will be your main sources of information
 for records not already populated. 

● Understood! I'll save the leader verification plan to planning/ for future
   use, then create a new plan for role extraction.

     # Leader Verification Plan
     **Status:** Deferred - to be incorporated into broader QA/verification
     pass
     **Created:** 24 November 2025
     **Deferred reason:** Only 1 record with empty leader; 267/268 (99.6%)
     already populated

● Good, the leader plan is saved. Now let me explore the role extraction
  task:

● 3 Explore agents finished (ctrl+o to expand)
   ├─ Analyse role coverage in attribution.csv · 8 tool uses · 25.4k tokens
   │  ⎿  Done
   ├─ Inventory all diary sources for roles · 1 tool use · 16.1k tokens
   │  ⎿  Done
   └─ Review role extraction requirements · 10 tool uses · 44.2k tokens
      ⎿  Done

● Excellent findings! I have a clear picture now:

  Current Role Coverage

  | Role           | Populated | Coverage |
  |----------------|-----------|----------|
  | Author         | 210       | 78.4%    |
  | PDA_Operator   | 30        | 11.2%    |
  | GPS_Operator   | 25        | 9.3%     |
  | Paper_Recorder | 11        | 4.1%     |
  | Data_Editor    | 8         | 3.0%     |
  | Photographer   | 3         | 1.1%     |

  Key insights:
  - 2010 is the only year with meaningful role data
  - Two extraction scripts already exist (extract_roles_kaz2010.py,
  extract_roles_elh2010.py)
  - 30+ diary sources available (PRIMARY, SECONDARY, SUPPLEMENTAL)
  - 175 records flagged "No role data available"

  Let me update the plan file:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/glittery-wondering-spring.md

● I've created the role extraction plan. Here's a summary:

  Role Extraction Plan Summary

  Goal: Extract role data from 30+ diary sources to improve coverage for
  PDA_Operator, GPS_Operator, Paper_Recorder, Data_Editor, Photographer, and
   Author fields.

  Current vs Target Coverage

  | Role           | Current | Target |
  |----------------|---------|--------|
  | Author         | 78%     | 90%+   |
  | PDA_Operator   | 11%     | 30-50% |
  | GPS_Operator   | 9%      | 30-50% |
  | Paper_Recorder | 4%      | 20-30% |
  | Photographer   | 1%      | 10-20% |

  Processing Order (by gap severity)

  1. Kazanlak 2009 - 76 records, ~1% coverage, 12 diaries
  2. Kazanlak 2011 - 60 records, ~0-7% coverage, 8 diaries + AUS_Diaries
  3. Elhovo 2009 - 35 records, ~1% coverage, 6 diaries
  4. Kazanlak 2010 - 70 records, ~30% coverage (fill gaps)
  5. Elhovo 2010 - 27 records, ~30% coverage (fill gaps)

  Approach

  - Read each diary systematically (PRIMARY → SECONDARY → SUPPLEMENTAL)
  - Extract role mentions with NLP keyword patterns
  - Record all extractions with source citations
  - Apply only to empty fields (no overwrites)
  - Generate comprehensive report

  Do you have any questions about the plan, or shall I proceed?

> ok, a couple of suggestions: while running regex is an acceptable *first 
step* to get low-hanging fruit, the extraction will *require* you to 
manually review diaries an use your NLP capabilities to look for roles 
(based on our experience so far). If it would be more effective, you can 
break this task up into single season-team passes, especially for your first
 2-3 extraction atempts. Perhaps: (a) attempt the scripted regex approach 
across all files first, then (b) begin review of each season-team 
combination, one at a time, using your NLP capabilities to manually read the
 diaries looking for role information. What do you think? 

● That's an excellent refinement. You're right - the regex approach will
  only catch explicit structured mentions like "PDA: Petra", but diaries are
   predominantly narrative ("Hamish took photos while we walked the
  transects"). The two-phase approach makes sense:

  Phase A: Automated regex pass - Quick scan of all files for explicit role
  mentions (low-hanging fruit)

  Phase B: Manual NLP review - Season-by-season, team-by-team reading of
  diaries using my comprehension to extract narrative role mentions

  Breaking Phase B into discrete season-team passes is smart because:
  1. Each diary has different writing styles/conventions to learn
  2. Allows refinement of extraction patterns as we go
  3. Manageable chunks with clear progress markers
  4. You can review/validate extractions after each pass before continuing

  Let me update the plan:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/glittery-wondering-spring.md

● Good, I've updated the workflow. Let me also update the scripts section to
   match:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/glittery-wondering-spring.md

● I've updated the plan with the two-phase approach. Here's the revised
  workflow:

  Updated Role Extraction Workflow

  Phase A: Automated Regex Pass

  - Run extract-roles-regex.py across all diary files
  - Capture explicit patterns like "PDA: Name", "GPS operator: Name"
  - Expected yield: Low (baseline only)

  Phase B: Manual NLP Review (14 passes)

  Process one season-team at a time:

  | Pass     | Target                  | Notes                             |
  |----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | B.1-B.5  | Kazanlak 2009 Teams A-E | First passes - establish patterns |
  | B.6-B.8  | Elhovo 2009 Teams A-C   |                                   |
  | B.9-B.12 | Kazanlak 2011 Teams A-D | Include AUS_Diaries               |
  | B.13     | Kazanlak 2010 gaps      | Fill remaining                    |
  | B.14     | Elhovo 2010 gaps        | Fill remaining                    |

  After each pass: User reviews extractions before proceeding

  Phase C: Consolidate and Apply

  Merge all extractions → User review → Apply to attribution.csv

  Phase D: Generate Report

  Comprehensive documentation of all extractions

  ---
  This approach lets us:
  - Get quick wins from regex first
  - Learn diary patterns progressively
  - Allow validation checkpoints between passes
  - Refine extraction approach based on early learnings

  Does this look right? Ready to proceed?
