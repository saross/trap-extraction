> please look at archive/cc-interactions/2025-12-01-e.txt; I made an error 
when planning with you - it looks like we really don't have the DPFs, I 
apologise, I misunderstood. The survey unit forms are very heavy and tend to
 exceed maximium size. Please revise your plan so that you solve all 
problems that can confidently be solved with the diaries 
using the diaries alone, and fall back to daily PDF forms only where 
absolutely necessary. If that becomes the case, I will split the 
PDFs so they are managable, or I will look up specific pieces of information
 fo you. 

● I'll read the file to understand the previous planning context and then
  revise the plan accordingly.

● Read(archive/cc-interactions/2025-12-01-e.txt)
  ⎿  Read 257 lines

● I understand the situation. The PDFs are too large and cause API errors.
  Let me explore what's actually in the Bulgarian diaries to understand what
   verification is possible, and look at the QA runsheet format to
  understand what needs to be verified.

● Explore(Explore diary content and QA format)
  ⎿  Done (18 tool uses · 61.0k tokens · 6m 16s)                           

● Excellent - the exploration confirms that Bulgarian diaries contain most
  of what we need: dates, unit ranges, team composition, and non-survey
  days. The main limitation is role assignments (leader vs walker).

  Let me write the revised plan:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/happy-tinkering-kay.md

● Plan written. I have two questions to clarify before we proceed:
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · For role assignments (leader vs walker), the diaries list team 
     members but don't specify roles. How should I handle this? → Accept 
     unknown
     · When diary data and CSV data conflict, how should I treat the 
     discrepancy? → In many cases you can judge by *coherence*, e.g., which 
     unit numbers produce an unbroken sequence? or which team members are 
     most often seen on adjacent days? Please also note that you should have
      rules, heuristics, and observations in your extraction guidelines that
      elaborate on how to decide. We only need to resort to the survey unit 
     PDFs if we encounter a problem that cannot be coherently solved from 
     the diaries + CSVs.



● Good clarifications. Let me read the extraction guidelines to understand
  the heuristics available for resolving conflicts:

● Excellent - the QA guidance file has the exact heuristics and rules. Let
  me update the plan with this information:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/happy-tinkering-kay.md

● Now let me clean up the end of the plan to remove the answered questions
  and add the critical files reference:

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/happy-tinkering-kay.md

● Let me read the full plan to verify it's complete:

● Reading Plan(~/.claude/plans/happy-tinkering-kay.md)
  ⎿  Read 160 lines

● The plan is complete and addresses:

  1. Primary source change: Bulgarian diaries instead of PDFs
  2. Coherence rules: Unit continuity (C1), team stability (H1),
  one-team-per-day (H2) for conflict resolution
  3. Accepted limitations: Role data marked as "unknown" rather than seeking
   PDFs
  4. Fallback protocol: Only request PDF lookup if coherence cannot resolve
  an issue

  The workflow follows the established QA pattern from previous teams, with
  the key adaptation being diary-primary verification.

     Revised QA Plan: Kazanlak 2011 Teams A and D

     Summary

     Complete QA verification for the final 2 teams (KAZ-2011-A and 
     KAZ-2011-D) using Bulgarian diaries as the primary source, with PDF 
     fallback only for issues that cannot be resolved from diaries.

     Key Constraint

     Day PDFs are too large for API processing. User will assist by 
     splitting PDFs or looking up specific information if needed.

     Source Availability

     | Team       | CSV Records                 | BG Diary             | Day
      PDFs                |
     |------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|----
     ---------------------|
     | KAZ-2011-A | 17 records (16 Oct - 3 Nov) | ✓ A_2011Diary_BG.doc | 
     Available but too large |
     | KAZ-2011-D | 14 records (14 Oct - 2 Nov) | ✓ D_2011Diary_BG.doc | 
     Available but too large |

     What Can Be Verified from Diaries Alone

     | Verification Step        | Diary Capability               | 
     Confidence |
     |--------------------------|--------------------------------|----------
     --|
     | Date verification        | ✓ Explicit date headers        | HIGH     
       |
     | Unit range verification  | ✓ Stated as "полигони с № X-Y" | HIGH     
       |
     | Team composition         | ✓ Full names listed            | HIGH     
       |
     | Non-survey days          | ✓ Explicit ("Дъждовен ден")    | HIGH     
       |
     | Weather cancellations    | ✓ Documented                   | HIGH     
       |
     | Date sequence continuity | ✓ Can check logical flow       | HIGH     
       |

     What CANNOT Be Verified from Diaries

     | Verification Step                   | Why Not                 | 
     Resolution                  |
     |-------------------------------------|-------------------------|------
     -----------------------|
     | Role assignments (leader vs walker) | Not recorded in diaries | 
     Accept "unknown" (per user) |
     | Walking order                       | Not recorded            | 
     Accept "unknown"            |
     | Precise unit counts per day         | Diaries summarise       | 
     Accept diary ranges         |

     ---
     Coherence-Based Conflict Resolution

     When diary data and CSV data conflict, apply these rules and heuristics
      from docs/qa-guidance.md:

     Rule C1: Unit Continuity

     The Start Unit of day N should equal or follow the End Unit of day N-1.

     - If one source produces an unbroken sequence and the other creates a 
     gap → prefer the continuous one
     - Negative gaps (units going backwards) are errors
     - Gaps > 1 may indicate missing records

     Heuristic H1: Team Stability

     Teams are generally stable over a season (but not entirely)

     - If a name is illegible or ambiguous, check nearby days for the same 
     team
     - Unexpected single-day walker changes should be treated with suspicion

     Heuristic H2: One Team Per Day

     A walker is typically on only one team per day

     - Use team membership constraints across dates to disambiguate names
     - If "Petra" appears on two teams on the same day, one is likely an 
     error

     Decision Process

     1. Check coherence first: Does diary + CSV together produce logical 
     continuity?
     2. Apply heuristics: Use team stability and one-team-per-day rules
     3. Flag unresolvable issues: Only request PDF lookup if coherence 
     cannot determine the answer

     ---
     Workflow Per Team

     Step 1: Extract CSV Records

     grep "2011-" outputs/attribution.csv | grep ",A,"  # Team A
     grep "2011-" outputs/attribution.csv | grep ",D,"  # Team D

     Step 2: Read Bulgarian Diary

     For each team, read the diary file and extract:
     - Date entries
     - Unit ranges for each date
     - Team members present
     - Non-survey days with reasons

     Step 3: Create Verification Table

     | Date | CSV Units | Diary Units | CSV Personnel | Diary Personnel | 
     Status |
     |------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---
     -----|

     Step 4: Document Verification Results

     For each date:
     - ✓ Match: Diary confirms CSV data
     - ⚠ Minor discrepancy: Note difference, diary provides correction
     - ❓ Unclear: Diary ambiguous (flag for potential PDF lookup)
     - ✗ Error: Clear mismatch requiring correction

     Step 5: Generate Runsheet

     Follow established format but with modified source attribution:
     - Primary source: Bulgarian diary
     - Note: "Role data unavailable (diary-only verification)"

     Step 6: Identify PDF-Required Issues (if any)

     Compile list of unresolvable issues for user review:
     - Issue description
     - Which PDF would resolve it
     - What specific information is needed

     Expected Runsheet Modifications

     The runsheets will differ from previous teams:
     - Source noted as "BG Diary" rather than "DPF Summary PDF"
     - Role assignments marked as "Not available from diary sources"
     - Walker lists may be incomplete (full team listed, roles unknown)

     Source Files

     Team A

     - CSV: grep "2011-" outputs/attribution.csv | grep ",A,"
     - Diary: /media/.../Team A/A_2011Diary_BG.doc

     Team D

     - CSV: grep "2011-" outputs/attribution.csv | grep ",D,"
     - Diary: /media/.../Team D/D_2011Diary_BG.doc

     Output Files

     - outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2011-autumn-a.md
     - outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2011-autumn-d.md
     - docs/qa-automation/qa-queue.yaml (update completed section)

     Execution Order

     1. KAZ-2011-A first (17 records)
     2. KAZ-2011-D second (14 records)
     3. Update queue to 18/18 (100%)

     User Decisions (Resolved)

     - Role data: Accept "unknown" - do not request PDF lookup
     - Conflict resolution: Use coherence (unit continuity, team stability) 
     to decide; only request PDF if coherence cannot resolve











● Plan approved. Let me set up tracking and begin execution.

● Now I have the full picture. Let me verify all the data and create the
  runsheet. I can see several discrepancies in the later dates where the CSV
   has default walkers but the diary shows different team composition.

  Let me read a recent exemplar runsheet to ensure correct format:

● Read(outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2011-autumn-b.md)
  ⎿  Read 156 lines

● Now I can create the runsheet. Based on my analysis:

  Unit verification: All 17 records have correct unit ranges - perfect
  continuity
  Walker discrepancies: Oct 29, 30, 31, Nov 1, Nov 2 have incorrect walker
  data in CSV

  Both teams have been verified using Bulgarian diaries as the primary
  source.

  KAZ-2011-A Summary (17 records)

  - Unit ranges: 100% correct (all 17 records match diary)
  - Walker discrepancies: 5 records (Oct 29, 30, 31, Nov 1, 2)
    - Root cause: Team composition changed late October; CSV had "default"
  walkers instead of actual daily teams
    - Notable: Nov 1-2 were predominantly foreign student survey days
  - Runsheet: outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2011-autumn-a.md

  KAZ-2011-D Summary (14 records)

  - Unit ranges: 100% correct (all 14 records match diary)
  - Walker discrepancies: 10 records
    - Missing Anani Antonov from 8 records (Oct 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27,
  28)
    - Missing Hristina Pavkova from 2 records (Oct 15, 16)
    - Root cause: Bulgarian abbreviated names (А. Антонов, Х. Павкова) not
  parsed during extraction
  - Runsheet: outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2011-autumn-d.md

  Answer: Mostly yes, but there's still a 10-unit gap (10114-10123) between
  Mar 08 and Mar 09. This gap exists in the DPF source data too — it's not a
   CSV error.

  Possible explanations:
  1. Missing record for Mar 10 (not in CSV or DPF)
  2. Units allocated to another team
  3. Units intentionally skipped

  Would you like me to investigate whether there's a Mar 10 record in the
  DPF or another team's data?

> Ok, we're low on context, can you compose a compact message? Afterwards, 
when we start the next session, I'd like you to (a) scan the attribution.csv
 to see if there is any sign of the missing range, then (b) process the 
changes in the three 'main' runsheets - but I'm sure there are other 
non-text runsheets that need to be reviewed, can you double-check? (AFTER 
compact - put these initial tasks in the /compact message)
