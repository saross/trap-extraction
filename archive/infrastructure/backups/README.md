# Attribution.csv Backups

**Last Updated:** 25 November 2025

Timestamped backups of `outputs/attribution.csv` created during the extraction process. These preserve the state of the dataset at key points for provenance documentation.

## Organisation

Backups are organised into dated subdirectories:

### 20251122-20251124/

20 backups from the initial extraction phases:

- Initial backups and phase 1/2 baselines
- Diary extraction checkpoints
- Date error corrections (Kazanluk 2010, 2011)
- Leader standardisation checkpoints
- Manual extraction work

### 20251125/

3 backups from name standardisation work:

- Pre-standardisation baseline
- Leader/role standardisation checkpoints

## Purpose

These backups provide:

1. **Provenance documentation** - Record of how data evolved
2. **Recovery capability** - Ability to revert if needed
3. **Quality assurance** - Verification of changes made

## Notes

- All backups are complete copies of `attribution.csv` at specific timestamps
- Filenames include descriptive suffixes and timestamps (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)
- The current authoritative version is always `outputs/attribution.csv`
