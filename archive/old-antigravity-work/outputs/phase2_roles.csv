Managed to do two hours of work in 14 hours. Draft of narrative of Otchet report for Yambol museum done, based on INSTAP re-application and the plans we sent to UNSW. Website updated to reflect Autumn 2009 work and Spring 2010 plans (including 2010 app form).  Emailed Andy about expanding / extending his work in Bulgaria (for the America for Bulgaria grant application), and he provided a brief description of what he would like to do","Feeling somewhat better. Finished typing the pottery ID forms into Excel in the morning. Adela, meanwhile worked on analysing pottery. I also finally convinced RoboGeo to read a Garmin tracklog, but had no matching pictures to test geotagging. Went into town to shop and for a break. Came back and started drawing pottery with Adela and Scott. Emailed the Pauline Taylor at the UNSW International Office to enquire about proceeding with the letter for Bulgarian recognition. Emailed Simon requesting plan and budget for extension of palaeoecological research (for the America for Bulgaria grant application). Finalised all travel arrangements for Nov-Jun (Europe to US and US to Australia and back).",

Radko and Jarka get assigned to him as well as Stanislav and Javor.,"We start fast but in two transects we hit a concentration and slow down markedly. Poor Katya is writing the forms literally on her knee, as she has given her clipboard to Team B. Not the best choice on the day when we have the biggest site ever.  By mid of the site we are tired of picking up the diagnostics. There is plenty of architectural pieces ( my concern at most of the previous sites). Infact they occur in regular intervals, suggestive of individual structures and pottery scatters outside them. There is abundance of finewares as well as fine paste amphoras, pithoi and HM wares. Plenty of diagnostics. The tiem is advancing and we progress slowly. By Unit 61240 we agree on picking an absolute minimum of diagnostics and those from periods outside Roman which prevails. Ilija wants to go to museum, and Katka and I are exhausted and pray for the site to finish. At the very south edge of the field there is a fallow piece where grass grows a meter high. I find a scatter of tiles on the first pass and Katka a large worked marble piece ( perhaps a wall stone or a base for state/column. Obviously the actual site is underneath this grassy surface, partially robbed ( zillion of holes) and partially excavated. The image looks like a field of craters",

11 September 2018,,,Team_A_Diary.docx,"Feature 8236 was located on the left of the road, and it was a potential extinct burial mound. We found 4 pieces of ancient pottery, which Adela observed and analysed, concluding that they were most probably from the Iron Age. On the right side of the road, was feature 8237 which had a metal cross, erected in the centre damaging any previous mounds. We were unsure which of these two features was what was marked on the legacy map, as neither of the features were marked where the point on the legacy map was, and both were ambiguous and not depicted on the map. Update: Both features now fall under the category “other”.",,
12 September 2018,,,Team_A_Diary.docx,,"We walked up to mound 8241, a legacy verification, which had an amazing view of the mountains. On top of the mound there was a concrete marker, and numerous bushes of berries. It was in pristine condition and had dimensions of 22 metres in diameter and 2.7 metres in height. Next to 8241 we located 8242 through survey, possibly the second of a couple mound. Three full size oak trees were located, one in the centre, and the other two on either side of the mound. On the peak we found a modern plastic bottle and cigarette packet evidence of modern human interaction. In the centre on the south slope, was a rectilinear robbers trench 8 metres wide and 1 metre wide. We found evidence of paper bees on the mound, along with exposed marble like stones scattered across the mound.",

17 September 2018,,,Team_B_Diary.docx,,"Bara set off at 7:30 with Team V to Popovo, where they started their survey. At 8:20 all teams A, B, T set off from the base. Toshko and Elissa were dropped off nearby the Malko Sharkovo Lake, and they were supposed to survey its southern shore. But as Elissa forgot their field equipment at the base (Tablet and the paper map) and Toshko wanted to give a chance to the fortune, they flipped a coin and surveyed the northern part of the Lake, ending up totally exhausted in Voden at 6PM. At 9:15, we dropped off Adela’s team in Sitevo, and they surveyed NE from Sitevo. We started our survey south from Sitevo.",

11 September 2018,,,Team_V_Diary.docx,,"Reason – Petra did not record the sites to the Burial mound module, as she though the module is only for mounds to be recorded and not for sites, but after coming back to base after talking to Bara and Adela, she decided to recreate the sites based on her paper-based field diary and notes. Luckily, the diary was detailed and external GPS points and photos were recorded while in the field, so all data was recovered – the only issue will be the points missing in the map and in the shapefile, but hopefully no one should return to the area and the two points need to be added to the final shapefile.",
12 September 2018,,,Team_V_Diary.docx,,"Then we thought we have finally found the mound, but the internal GPS of the tablet was giving us strange data, so we have restarted it and continued towards two different patches of grass and bushes only to discover none of them is mound.  However, we have recorded one of them as 9660, as it was very close to the point on the paper map, and on the device. Then we went to the dirt road next to the tree line to discuss about where to go next, but Petra walked to the forest as she was suspicious there might be a mound and was not entirely happy with the appearance of the mound 9660 and she has discovered a mound in the forest (9661), only approximately 2 metres from the current edge of the forest (it differs from the forest line on the paper maps). The mound had a tank embankment in one of its sides and was overgrown with trees, so it was hard to see.",

The house had a bed with books on the top of it, and we found a newspaper from the year 2000. After some investigation we decided the house didn’t actually impair the mound too badly, and it was otherwise in good condition bar a shallow RT on the northern side. It was all very amusing.",
