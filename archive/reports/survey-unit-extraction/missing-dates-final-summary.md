## Important Discoveries

### 1. Team C Survey Methodology Variation
Team C frequently conducted **alternative survey methods** that don't generate survey units:
- Mound reconnaissance and documentation
- Transect walking for site boundary definition
- Intensive site recording with GPS

This explains why Team C has the lowest coverage (79.45%) - they were often doing intensive site investigations rather than systematic unit-based survey.

### 2. Bulgarian Diary Format
- **Format:** DD.MM.YYYY г. (where г. = година/year)
- **No Roman numerals found** in Kazanluk diaries examined
- Bulgarian diaries often more detailed than English versions for field observations

### 3. Seasonal Patterns
- **Spring season:** March-April primary fieldwork period
- **Autumn season:** Limited or no systematic survey in 2009-2010
- **Weather impact:** Late March prone to rain cancellations

### 4. PDF Form Limitations
Some PDF Daily Progress Forms exist but:
- Units field left empty (intensive site work, not unit survey)
- Units field illegible or incorrectly formatted
- Individual unit cards instead of consolidated forms

## Conclusion

This investigation successfully explained **93.3% (28/30)** of missing survey unit dates through systematic diary examination. The remaining 2 dates require database verification or remain ambiguous due to incomplete diary coverage.

**Key insight:** Many "missing" survey units are not actually missing data - they represent days when **alternative survey methods** (mound documentation, transect surveys, intensive site recording) were used that don't generate survey unit numbers. This is particularly true for Team C in March 2009.

**Data quality impact:** This investigation changes our understanding from "missing data" to "different survey methodology," which has important implications for how these dates should be documented in the final attribution.csv submission to AKB.
