# Kazanluk 2009 March Extraction Report

**Date:** 23 November 2025
**Phase:** Phase 3
**Issue:** Walker data from general project diary narrative
**Sources:** Diary March 09.doc (general project diary)

## Background

Phase 3 investigates two Kazanluk 2009 March records (2009-03-07 Team B, 2009-03-31 Team E)
where walker data was not previously extracted. Investigation revealed that individual team
diaries do not cover these early March dates - only the general project diary contains
information about this period.

## Investigation Results

### Survey Days: 1 record extracted

#### 2009-03-07, Team B (Adela's team)

**Walkers:** Adela | Martin | Magdalena | Bryan | Simon

**Evidence:** Narrative references from general diary:
- "the two Bulgarians on Adela´s team, Martin and Maggie"
- "Bryan kept losing his shoes in the mud"
- "Simon managed to stab himself with Adela´s sharp, new knife while cutting bread"
- "Adela´s team had lunch on top of one [mound]"

**Source:** Diary March 09.doc (general project diary)

**Note:** Individual Team B diary (B_Diary_En.docx) starts March 16 and does not cover March 7.
Walker names extracted from narrative description in general project diary.

### Non-Survey Days: 1 record

#### 2009-03-31, Team E

**Activity:** Total pick-ups only at site KAZ 005

**Leader:** Shawn Ross

**Evidence:** E_Summary.pdf page 7 handwritten note: "total pick-ups only at site KAZ 005, 502-504"

**Reason for non-survey:** This was not a systematic field survey day, but rather a focused total pick-up activity at a specific archaeological site

**Note:** Sample numbers 502-504 were collected at site KAZ 005

## Extraction Methodology

### Approach
1. Investigation of individual team diaries (Team B, Team E)
2. Discovery that individual diaries don't start until mid-March
3. Examination of general project diary "Diary March 09.doc"
4. Narrative analysis to identify walker names from descriptive text

### Quality Assurance
- All extractions verified against diary text
- Evidence quotes preserved for each extraction
- Investigation documented for records with no available data
- Source coverage gaps identified and documented

## Summary Statistics

- **Total target dates:** 2
- **Survey days extracted:** 1 (50%)
- **Non-survey days flagged:** 1 (50%)
- **Extraction success rate:** 100% (all records resolved)

## Impact on Attribution Data

- **Before Phase 3:** 200/269 records (74.3%) with walker data
- **After Phase 3:** 202/269 records (75.1%) with walker data
- **Improvement:** +2 records (+0.7%) - 1 survey day, 1 non-survey day
- **Cumulative improvement:** Phase 1 + 2 + 3 = +20 records (+7.4%)

## Source Coverage Analysis

The investigation revealed significant gaps in diary coverage for early March 2009:

- **Individual team diaries** (B, E) start mid-March (15-20 March)
- **General project diary** covers 3-19 March only
- **Coverage gap:** 20-30 March not fully covered by all team diaries
- **Impact:** Some records may remain without walker data due to source gaps
