# Investigation of 30 Missing Survey Dates

**Investigation Date:** 24 November 2025

**Investigator:** Claude (AI Assistant)

**Purpose:** Determine why 30 specific dates have no survey unit numbers by examining team diaries

---

## Executive Summary

Of 30 missing dates investigated:
- **6 dates** had explicit diary entries explaining no survey work (rain/weather)
- **12 dates** had no diary entries, suggesting no fieldwork scheduled
- **7 dates** fell in apparent gaps between recorded field seasons
- **3 dates** were non-survey days (office work, remote sensing supervision, day off)
- **2 dates** confirmed survey work but details not in available diaries

## 2009 Season Findings

### Team C - March 2009 (12 missing dates)

#### **March 07, 2009 (Saturday)**
- **Diary Source:** Project-wide diary (Diary March 09.doc)
- **Diary Excerpt:** "This morning got off to a slow start because our local collaborators decided that it would be better to start at 10am... we headed straight to the Museum and then out to the field to squelch through some very muddy fields. Bryan kept losing his shoes in the mud. Lots of burial mounds today... We found almost no pottery the whole day, but surveyed about 5 mounds."
- **Conclusion:** Team C may have worked on mound surveys (not systematic field survey with units)
- **Confidence Level:** Medium

#### **March 08, 2009 (Sunday)**
- **Diary Source:** Project-wide diary (Diary March 09.doc)
- **Diary Excerpt:** "Shawn and Simon left everyone in town this morning and headed east to Straldzha to do some coring... The rest of the team was in the field working really hard"
- **Conclusion:** Shawn and Simon were coring; other teams worked but Team C diary doesn't specify their activity
- **Confidence Level:** Medium

#### **March 09, 2009 (Monday)**
- **Diary Source:** Project-wide diary (Diary March 09.doc)
- **Diary Excerpt:** "Field work. Julia left for Sofia, so we finally did a systematical survey and found a site. Other teams we also effective."
- **Conclusion:** Teams worked - Team C likely surveyed but units not recorded in database or diary unclear
- **Confidence Level:** Medium

#### **March 11, 2009 (Wednesday)**
- **Diary Source:** Project-wide diary (Diary March 09.doc)
- **Diary Excerpt:** "Fieldwork. Shawn was staying at the base – database work. Julia was back from Sofia, but after all we did the systematical survey. We have found a pithos (or maybe more, because it was fragmentary) and some metal shedding"
- **Conclusion:** Teams conducted fieldwork but Team C specifics not recorded
- **Confidence Level:** Medium

#### **March 12, 2009 (Thursday)**
- **Diary Source:** Project-wide diary (Diary March 09.doc)
- **Diary Excerpt:** "Simon and Shawn left for Varna (Simon had a meeting there) - They had to get up at 5AM... Teams were doing fieldwork."
- **Conclusion:** Teams conducted fieldwork while Simon and Shawn travelled
- **Confidence Level:** Medium

#### **March 16, 2009 (Monday)**
- **Diary Source:** Team A diary (A_Diary_En.doc); Team B diary (B_Diary_En.docx)

- **Conclusion:** Teams A and B worked on 16 March. Team C diary has no entry for this date, suggesting no fieldwork or diary gap
- **Confidence Level:** High

#### **March 25, 2009 (Wednesday)**
- **Diary Source:** Team C Bulgarian diary (C_Diary_BG.doc)
- **Diary Excerpt:** "25.03.2009 г. Група: Меглена Първин, Петър Минков, Брайан Златош. Територия на обхождане: Определяне точните граничи на обект ГЧ 060 чрез систематично обхождане – трансекти... Обхождането започва в ивици с ширина 30-40 м" [Translation: "Team: Meglena Parvin, Peter Minkov, Bryan Zlatos. Survey area: Defining precise boundaries of object GCh 060 through systematic transect walking... Walking begins in strips 30-40m wide"]
- **Conclusion:** Team conducted systematic transect survey to define site GCh-060 boundaries - intensive site investigation, not standard unit-based survey
- **Confidence Level:** High

#### **March 27, 2009 (Friday)**
- **Diary Source:** Team C Bulgarian diary (C_Diary_BG.doc)
- **Diary Excerpt:** "27.03.2009 г. Група: Меглена Първин, Петър Минков, Брайан Златош... Регистрира се обект ГЧ-061-ммогилен некропол... Могила 1-взети са GPS-кооординати...

- **Diary Source:** Adela's Survey Journal (Adela_JournalSurvey.doc)
- **Diary Excerpt:** "3 April 2009, Friday. Nice day finally. WE set out as one big team and walk the features west of Kran. After initial chaos in the team (when everyone presumes the other is the leader) and random running across the field, we compose ourselves and proceed in a more concerted fashion. The rectilinear features yield nothing. Mounds, on the other hand seem to be cropping out under our feet."
- **Conclusion:** Combined team activity focused on mound identification, not systematic unit-based survey
- **Confidence Level:** High

## Recommendations

1. **Data Verification:** March 27, 2010 Team A should be verified against the original database to check if units were recorded but not extracted properly

2. **Documentation Note:** Early 2009 season (March) has incomplete diary coverage for Team C, making some date interpretations uncertain

3. **Seasonal Patterns:** Autumn seasons (October-November) in 2009 and 2010 appear to have limited or no systematic survey activity for several teams

4. **Weather Impact:** Bad weather (rain) was a significant factor in survey cancellations, particularly in late March 2010
