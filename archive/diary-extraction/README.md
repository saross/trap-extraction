# Diary Extraction Planning Archive

**Completion Date:** November 2025

This archive contains planning and search documentation for diary-based data extraction across the TRAP project.

## Project Summary

- **Purpose:** Systematic planning for extracting walker and role data from field diaries
- **Scope:** Identified available diary sources across all seasons (2009-2011)
- **Status:** COMPLETED - Planning phase; actual extraction work documented elsewhere

## Files

- `diary-extraction-plan.md` - Comprehensive extraction strategy and methodology
- `diary-extraction-report.md` - Report on diary availability and extraction priorities
- `diary-search-results.md` - Search results cataloguing available diary sources

## Key Outcomes

- Complete inventory of diary sources across all teams and seasons
- Prioritisation framework (Tier 1: Excel → Tier 2: Diaries → Tier 3: PDFs)
- Extraction methodology for handling inconsistencies
- Foundation for subsequent supersession project

## Related Work

- **Supersession Project:** Used this planning work to identify PRIMARY sources
  - See: `archive/supersession-project/`
- **Source Inventory:** Complete source catalogue maintained in `outputs/source-inventory.md`

## Notes

These planning documents were instrumental in:
1. Identifying the Team A and Team B supersession cases
2. Establishing source hierarchy and prioritisation rules
3. Guiding systematic extraction approach
