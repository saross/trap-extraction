> /compact ● Session Summary - 25 November 2025 (Leader and Role 
Standardisation)

  Completed: Leader and Role Column Standardisation

  Successfully standardised 7 columns in outputs/attribution.csv to canonical 
"First Last" names:

  | Column         | Changes | Cleared |
  |----------------|---------|---------|
  | Leader         | 253     | 1       |
  | PDA_Operator   | 44      | 0       |
  | Paper_Recorder | 43      | 1       |
  | Data_Editor    | 8       | 3       |
  | GPS_Operator   | 37      | 0       |
  | Photographer   | 14      | 0       |
  | Author         | 194     | 1       |
  | Total          | 593     | 6       |

  Key changes:
  - Multiple leaders now use pipe separators (e.g., "Julia, Baba" → "Julia 
Tzvetkova | Bara Weissová")
  - Metadata entries cleared from Paper_Recorder (Images, Track Log, Diary)
  - Placeholders cleared from Data_Editor (No, Note, Hm, Vitaha)
  - Combined Author entries split ("Bryan Zlatos, CB" → "Bryan Zlatos | 
Charlotte Devereux Byron")

  Files created/modified:
  - scripts/standardise-leaders-roles.py - New standardisation script
  - outputs/attribution.csv - 593 values standardised
  - outputs/name-mapping.csv - 23 new entries added (now 698 total)
  - outputs/leader-role-standardisation-report.md - New report
  - planning/follow-up-actions.md - Added 2010-04-09 Team B walker discrepancy

  Unmapped names (2):
  - Lizzy (Paper_Recorder) - Czech volunteer, identity being researched
  - Helvecia (Data_Editor, 2010-03-28 Team A) - Unknown entry, requires 
investigation

  User clarifications during planning:
  - P.H. in Author column is OCR error for SH → Sona Holičková (user verified 
from scanned forms)
  - Vitaha is an error entry on non-fieldwork day (2010-03-27) - cleared
  - 2010-04-09 Team B has walker discrepancy: CSV shows "Adela | Petra Tušlová |
 Peter" but diary/form shows "Adela,
  Dasha, Pesho, Stana" - added to follow-up-actions.md

> Hi CC, welcome back. If you look at attribution.csv you'll see I corrected
 a few things, including the final outstanding extraction ('Helvecia', 
actually 'Lindsay' - I checked diaries and scanned progress forms). I also 
corrected 'Prazak Lindsay' to 'Lindsay Prazak' in attribution.csv and 
name-mapping.csv.\
\
What remains on our to-do list? 

● Welcome back! Good to hear you resolved the Helvecia → Lindsay mystery.
  Let me check the current state of the follow-up actions.

● Read(planning/follow-up-actions.md)
  ⎿  Read 404 lines

● Based on the follow-up-actions.md, here's what remains:

  The walker discrepancy (item 4) and participant identities seem the most
  actionable for data quality. Would you like to tackle any of these, or is
  there something else you had in mind?

> ok, the things in 'follow-up-actions.md' are actually for *after* we 
finish all of the rest of the work here, as they cannot be solved by any 
*internal* evidence, we are going to have to look at paper records, talk to 
former participants, etc. What I'm looking for is extraction work that can 
be completed with the data we have. I believe we have already standardise 
names and enhanced roles? I believe we may be down to QA tasks, there should
 be a plan somewhere to check 'leader', which we can review - BUT if we are 
done with other things I'd like to (a) clean up the repo and (b) seriously 
discuss QA approaches with you. Anything else we need to do? 

● Good clarification - let me check what extraction work remains and find
  that leader QA plan.

● Search(pattern: "planning/**/*.md")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Search(pattern: "**/*plan*.md")
  ⎿  Found 4 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "**/*checklist*.md")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Found them. Let me check the current state of these plans:

● Read(planning/leader-verification-plan.md)
  ⎿  Read 166 lines

● Read(planning/name-standardisation-plan.md)
  ⎿  Read 295 lines

● Read(planning/role-extraction-checklist.md)
  ⎿  Read 200 lines

● You're right. Looking at the plans:

  | Task                               | Status
             |
  |------------------------------------|------------------------------------
  -----------|
  | Walker name standardisation        | ✅ COMPLETE (25 Nov)
              |
  | Role extraction                    | ✅ Complete (24 Nov) - 76 fields
  populated     |
  | Leader/role column standardisation | ✅ COMPLETE (25 Nov) - 593 values
  standardised |
  | Leader verification                | Deferred to QA pass (99.6% already
  populated) |

  Extraction work is effectively done. The leader verification plan was
  explicitly deferred because:
  - 267/268 (99.6%) already have leaders
  - Only 1 empty record (2010-04-06 Team B - non-survey rainy day)
  - Better to incorporate into broader QA pass

  So you're right - we're at the stage for:

  1. Repo cleanup - archive completed plans, organise outputs, update
  documentation
  2. QA discussion - design a verification approach for the completed
  dataset

  Before we dive in, let me quickly check if there's an existing
  akb-submission-todo or similar master checklist that tracks overall
  progress:

● Search(pattern: "**/*todo*.md")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "**/*submission*.md")
  ⎿  Found 4 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● This akb-submission-todo.md is out of date. Based on the completed plans
  I've read, here's the actual status:

  | 10. Submission metadata    | ⏸️ Pending             |
                           |

  Bottom line: Extraction work is complete. What remains:
  1. QA exercise (the main intellectual task)
  2. Documentation (data dictionary, metadata)
  3. Packaging (for submission and secondary QA)

  Ready to:
  - (a) Clean up the repo - update this todo, archive completed plans,
  organise files
  - (b) Discuss QA approaches - design verification strategy

  Which would you like to tackle first, or both in parallel?

> Yes, let's undertake (a); please archive completed plans, one-off reports 
or scripts, superceded documents, etc., plus review all existing 
documentation to make sure it's up-to-date (checklists, to-dos, readmes, 
FAIR4RS documentation, etc.). Please make a plan to accomplish this 
comprehensively 

● I'll start by reading the existing plan file, then explore the repository
  structure to understand what needs cleanup.

● Reading Plan(~/.claude/plans/distributed-seeking-emerson.md)
  ⎿  Read 256 lines

● This is a different task (repo cleanup vs the completed leader/role
  standardisation), so I'll start a fresh plan. Let me explore the
  repository structure to understand what needs cleanup.

● 3 Explore agents finished (ctrl+o to expand)
   ├─ Explore repo directory structure · 18 tool uses · 31.4k tokens
   │  ⎿ Done
   ├─ Find planning docs and checklists · 14 tool uses · 41.8k tokens
   │  ⎿ Done
   └─ Find reports and documentation · 25 tool uses · 50.0k tokens
      ⎿ Done

● Excellent - I now have a comprehensive view of the repository. The
  exploration reveals:

  Key Findings:
  1. 221 total files - well-organised but some cleanup needed
  2. 5 planning docs - 3 complete (ready to archive), 2 active but one
  outdated
  3. Intermediate files in outputs/ that could be archived
  4. akb-submission-todo.md is significantly outdated (shows only Task 1
  done, but Tasks 2-4 are also complete)
  5. Root documentation (README, PROJECT-COMPLETION, etc.) appears current

  Before I write the plan, I have a few questions:
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · The outputs/ folder contains 8 intermediate role-extraction CSV files
      and 6 diary extract text files. Should these be archived or kept in 
     outputs/? → Archive them

     · akb-submission-todo.md shows only Task 1 complete but Tasks 2-4 are 
     also done. How should we handle it? → Update it, then *if all tasks are
      done* archive it; if tasks remain, leave it where it is
     · There are 36 Claude Code interaction logs in archive/cc-interactions/
      (~3.9MB). What's your preference? → Keep all

● Good - clear guidance. Let me check a few key files to understand their
  current state, then write the comprehensive plan.

● Read(README.md)
  ⎿  Read 435 lines

● Read(PROJECT-COMPLETION.md)
  ⎿  Read 624 lines

● I now have comprehensive information. The README.md and
  PROJECT-COMPLETION.md are mostly current but have a few outdated sections.
   Let me write the cleanup plan.

● Updated plan
  ⎿  /plan to preview · ~/.claude/plans/distributed-seeking-emerson.md

● The plan is now complete. Here's a summary of what it covers:

  Repository Cleanup Plan Summary

  6 Phases:

  1. Archive Completed Plans (3 files)
    - name-standardisation-plan.md → archive/planning/
    - role-extraction-checklist.md → archive/planning/
    - leader-verification-plan.md → archive/planning/
  2. Archive Intermediate Files (14 files)
    - 8 role-extraction CSV files →
  archive/intermediate-data/role-extractions/
    - 6 diary extract text files → archive/intermediate-data/diary-extracts/
  3. Update akb-submission-todo.md
    - Mark Tasks 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 as complete
    - Keep active (remaining QA tasks)
  4. Update Root Documentation
    - README.md: Fix broken links, update Future Work section, correct
  statistics
    - PROJECT-COMPLETION.md: Update Outstanding Tasks, verify survey unit
  numbers
    - CHANGELOG.md: Add 25 Nov standardisation entries
  5. Verify Cross-References
    - Fix outputs/follow-up-actions.md → planning/follow-up-actions.md
    - Fix claude_extraction/akb-submission-todo.md →
  planning/akb-submission-todo.md
  6. Final Verification & Commit

  Note: I identified a discrepancy in survey unit statistics (README says
  250/268 = 93.3%, but follow-up-actions says 239/268 = 89.18%). I'll verify
   the correct figure during execution.

     3.3 Updates Required

     - Mark Tasks 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 as complete with dates
     - Update status line: "In progress - Tasks 1-4, 7-8 completed"
     - Update "Last updated" date
     - If all tasks complete → archive; if tasks remain → keep active

     ---
     Phase 4: Update Root Documentation

     4.1 README.md Updates

     Issues identified:

     1. Future Work section - mentions items now complete:
       - "Role data extraction" → Done (76 fields)
       - "Name standardisation" → Done (walkers + leaders + roles)
     2. Broken link: claude_extraction/akb-submission-todo.md → should be 
     planning/akb-submission-todo.md
     3. Incorrect path: outputs/follow-up-actions.md → should be 
     planning/follow-up-actions.md
     4. Script count: Says "45 total" but there are 51 scripts
     5. Survey unit coverage: Says 18 missing, but follow-up-actions says 29
      (239/268 = 89.18%)

     Updates:
     - Correct file paths
     - Update Future Work to reflect completed items
     - Update script count
     - Verify survey unit statistics

     4.2 PROJECT-COMPLETION.md Updates

     Issues identified:

     1. Outstanding Tasks section - lists items now complete:
       - "Investigate 12 failed diary extractions" → completed
       - "Name format standardisation" → completed
     2. Survey unit statistics inconsistency:
       - Says "93.3% | 250/268"
       - Follow-up-actions says "89.18% (239/268)"
       - Need to verify correct figure

     Updates:

       351    ## Notes
       352    
       353 -  - Name-mapping document location: Currently in 
           - `archive/name-disambiguation/name-mapping.csv` - may need to
           -  be moved to active location
       354 -  - Role extraction (Task 4) is most time-intensive but 
           - provides significant value
       355 -  - Consider running automated checks before manual review to
           -  prioritise effort
       356 -  - Secondary QA package can be prepared incrementally as 
           - tasks complete
       353 +  - Name-mapping document location: 
           + `outputs/name-mapping.csv` (698 entries, authoritative)
       354 +  - Role extraction (Task 4) completed - 76 new fields 
           + populated, <50% coverage due to source limitations
       355 +  - Name standardisation (Task 3) completed - all personnel 
           + columns standardised
       356 +  - Remaining tasks: QA exercise (5), Extraction notes review
           +  (9), Submission packaging (6, 10)

       78    1. **Role data incomplete:** PDA operator, paper recorder, 
            and other role fields have <50% coverage due to limited 
            source documentation
       79 -  2. **Survey units incomplete:** 29 records (10.82%) without 
          -  survey unit numbers
          -  : 28 records explained (alternative survey methodologies, 
          -  weather cancellations, non-survey days), 1 record pending 
          -  renumbering investigation (six-digit to five-digit unit 
          -  conversion)
