             autumn (column 10 = "x"), but she does not appear in any walker records for that season. Tereza Dobrovodská is 
             clearly documented on Team C (Oct 12-22) and Team A (Oct 26-29 as Eric's substitute). T. Blažková may have had a 
             specialist role (ceramics, bioarchaeology, finds processing) rather than field walking that season. No action 
             required unless participant list accuracy review is undertaken. (Discovered during D016 QA, 26 Nov 2025)

● I've expanded the documentation in follow-up-actions.md. Now let me discuss the six-digit mountain survey problem with you:

  Six-Digit Mountain Survey Problem - Summary

  From re-examining the DPF (C_2009Summary.pdf), I can now see the issue clearly:

  Two numbering systems used by Team C:
  1. Five-digit (30xxx) - Standard intensive survey units
  2. Six-digit (300xxx) - "Mountain survey" / polygon units

  Affected dates identified:

  | Date   | Type           | Numbers                                            | Status                            |
  |--------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | Mar 6  | Both           | 30025-30034 (intensive) + 300000-300002 (mountain) | Intensive OK; mountain needs line |
  | Mar 12 | Mountain only  | 300003-300009 (skip 300008)                        | Already documented                |
  | Mar 20 | Mountain only  | 300080-300???                                      | I misread as 30080-30133          |
  | Mar 23 | Both           | 30065-30097 (intensive) + 300012-300020 (mountain) | Need separate lines               |
  | Mar 25 | Intensive only | 30132-30170                                        | This IS five-digit, correct       |

  Questions for you:

  1. Mar 20: Looking at page 3, I see Start Unit "300,080" and End Unit that could be "300,033" or "300,133". Since 300033 <
  300080 (impossible), the end must be 300133. Is this correct, or can you read the handwriting better?
  2. Mar 23: You mentioned needing separate lines in attribution.csv. Currently the CSV has one erroneous line (30012-30170).
  Should I:
    - Option A: Update to just the intensive line (30065-30097) and create a NEW record for mountain survey (300012-300020)?
    - Option B: Keep the existing line for intensive, flag the mountain survey in follow-up-actions.md, and defer the new record
  creation?
  3. Mar 6: The DPF Comments mention "MOUNTAIN POLYGONS 300,000-002" alongside the intensive units 30025-30034. Should this also
  get a separate line for the mountain work?
  4. Processing the other 3 runsheets: KAZ-2009-B, KAZ-2009-D, and KAZ-2010-D appear to have straightforward five-digit
  corrections with no six-digit complications. Should I proceed with adding those to the corrections manifest while we resolve
  the Team C issues?

> The Mar 20 'mountian polygons' are numbered 300030-300033. \
\
Mar 23: Update to just the intensive line (30065-30097) and create a NEW record for mountain survey (300012-300020_\
Mar 6: Yes, separate line with mountain poly 300000-300002.\
Yes, add all the other corrections to the manifest, these 'mountain survey six-digit numbers' were the only serious problem 

● Got it! Let me update the documentation with the correct Mar 20 numbers, update the runsheet, and then add all corrections to
  the manifest.

● Now let me update the KAZ-2009-C runsheet with the correct corrections:

● Update(outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2009-spring-c.md)
  ⎿  Updated outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2009-spring-c.md with 9 additions and 12 removals                                   
       158    
       159    ## Corrections Required
       160    
       161 -  ### D001: Mar 20 End Unit (VERIFIED - NO CORRECTION NEEDED)
       161 +  ### D001: Mar 20 Unit Range (SIX-DIGIT MOUNTAIN SURVEY)
       162    
       163    **Record:** 2009-03-20, Team C
       164 -  **Field:** End_Unit
       165 -  **Current:** 30133
       166 -  **DPF shows:** End Unit field shows "300,033" which is ambiguous handwriting
       167 -  **Source evidence:** DPF (C_2009Summary.pdf, page 3) shows Start Unit: 30080, End Unit: unclear (appears as 
           - "300,033"). Since Start Unit is 30080, the End Unit must be higher. The CSV value 30133 is the most reasonable 
           - interpretation of the handwriting.
       168 -  **Reasoning:** Given that 30033 would be lower than the Start Unit (impossible), and the handwriting could be 
           - interpreted as 30,133 with a stylised comma, the CSV value of 30133 is likely correct. The unit sequence also 
           - supports this: Mar 20 (30080-30133) followed by Mar 23 (30065-30097 which fills earlier gap) and Mar 24 
           - (30098-30131).
       164 +  **Field:** Start_Unit, End_Unit
       165 +  **Current CSV:** 30080-30133 (incorrect five-digit interpretation)
       166 +  **Corrected:** 300030-300033 (six-digit mountain polygon numbers)
       167 +  **Source evidence:** DPF (C_2009Summary.pdf, page 3) shows six-digit mountain polygon numbers: Start Unit: 
           + 300030, End Unit: 300033. This was mountain polygon work, not intensive survey.
       168 +  **Reasoning:** The numbers on the DPF are six-digit "old format" mountain survey units (300xxx), not five-digit 
           + intensive survey units (30xxx). These six-digit numbers were supposed to be retroactively converted to five-digit
           +  format, but the mapping is unknown. Preserve the six-digit numbers until the official mapping is found.
       169    
       170    **User Decision:**
       171 -  - [ ] Keep current value (30133) - most reasonable interpretation
       172 -  - [X] Modify: Please see planning/follow-up-actions.md, this is a known issue (see below), and we need to keep 
           - the 'old' six-digit numbers until we can find the 'new' five-digit numbers, which I have not yet been able to do.
           -  PRESERVE the six-digit numbers and DO NOT GUESS at the five digit numbers unless we find a convincing 
           - alternative. Where are five digit numbers you are suggesting coming from for 20 March 2009? If they are 
           - interpretations of the handwriting, they are incorrect, the numbers are six-digit. Follow up with me separately 
           - in chat on this matter.
       173 -  **Survey unit numbers found:**
       174 -  - **Old format (six-digit):** 300003-300009 (with 300008 skipped - 6 units total)
       175 -  - **New format (five-digit):** Unknown - requires mapping investigation
       171 +  - [X] Approve correction to 300030-300033 (preserve six-digit format)
       172 +  - [ ] Modify: _______________

       178 -  ### D002: Mar 23 Unit Range (MAJOR ERROR)
       178 +  ### D002: Mar 23 Unit Range (TWO CORRECTIONS REQUIRED)
       179    
       180    **Record:** 2009-03-23, Team C
       181    **Field:** Start_Unit, End_Unit
       182 -  **Current:** 30012, 30170
       183 -  **Corrected:** 30065, 30097
       184 -  **Source evidence:** DPF (C_2009Summary.pdf, page 4) shows TWO separate forms for March 23:
       185 -    - **Form 1 (Intensive survey):** Leader: CB/Elena, Start Unit: 30065, End Unit: 30097, Total Units: 33, 
           - Author: CB
       186 -    - **Form 2 (Mountain survey):** Leader: E, Start Unit: 300012, End Unit: 300020, Total: 9 (mountain polygon 
           - numbers, NOT intensive units)
       187 -  **Reasoning:** The CSV erroneously combined the mountain polygon start number (300012 → misread as 30012) with 
           - the Mar 25 End Unit (30170). The correct intensive survey range for Mar 23 is 30065-30097. This also explains the
           -  unit sequence: Mar 19 ends at 30064, Mar 23 starts at 30065 (continuous), Mar 23 ends at 30097, Mar 24 starts at
           -  30098 (continuous).
       182 +  **Current CSV:** 30012-30170 (erroneous combination of mountain and intensive numbers)
       183    
       184 +  **Correction A - Update existing record to intensive survey:**
       185 +  - **Corrected:** 30065-30097
       186 +  - **Source evidence:** DPF Form 1 (C_2009Summary.pdf, page 4): Leader: CB/Elena, Start Unit: 30065, End Unit: 
           + 30097, Total Units: 33, Author: CB
       187 +  
       188 +  **Correction B - ADD NEW RECORD for mountain survey:**
       189 +  - **New record:** 2009-03-23, Team C (Mountain Survey)
       190 +  - **Units:** 300012-300020 (six-digit format, preserve as-is)
       191 +  - **Source evidence:** DPF Form 2 (C_2009Summary.pdf, page 4): Leader: E, Start Unit: 300012, End Unit: 300020, 
           + Total: 9
       192 +  
       193 +  **Reasoning:** The CSV erroneously combined mountain polygon start (300012 → misread as 30012) with Mar 25 end 
           + unit (30170). Mar 23 had TWO separate survey activities requiring TWO separate CSV lines:
       194 +  1. Intensive survey: 30065-30097 (five-digit, normal)
       195 +  2. Mountain survey: 300012-300020 (six-digit, pending mapping)
       196 +  
       197    **User Decision:**
       198 -  - [ ] Approve correction to 30065-30097
       199 -  - [X] Modify: Again, I looked and these are issues with 'old' six-digit 'mountain survey' numbers 
           - (300012-300020). At some point they would have been retroactively replaced with 'new' five-digit numbers, bbut we
           -  don't know what they are, so leave them as six-digit numbers. **NOTE: there are TWO DPFs for 23 march 2009, the 
           - first one with numbers 30065-30097 is fine, it's 'normal' survey, while the second one covers 'mountain' survey -
           -  these need separate lines in the attribution CSV until we can reconcile the six-digit numbers (which should have
           -  ultimately been replaced with 'new' five-digit SU numbers). Please discuss with me in chat after reviewing the 
           - previous note and the follow-up-actions where this problem is recognised.

  Corrections Summary

  Total new corrections: 17 (bringing manifest total to 65)
  - Unit corrections: 14
  - New records to add: 3 (Mar 08 Team B, Mar 06 & Mar 23 Team C mountain survey)

  Six-Digit Mountain Survey Numbers

  Fully documented in planning/follow-up-actions.md:
  - Mar 6: 300000-300002 (new record needed)
  - Mar 12: 300003-300009 (already documented)
  - Mar 20: 300030-300033 (correction to existing record)
  - Mar 23: 300012-300020 (new record needed)

  These are preserved as six-digit numbers pending discovery of the official mapping to five-digit format.

  Files Updated

  - outputs/qa-corrections-manifest-comprehensive.json - 17 new corrections added
  - outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2009-spring-c.md - Updated with correct six-digit handling
  - planning/follow-up-actions.md - Expanded six-digit documentation with all affected dates
