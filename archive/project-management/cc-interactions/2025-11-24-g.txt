> /compact   Session Summary: Final Investigation of 3 Ambiguous Survey Unit 
Dates

  Context: Continuation of TRAP survey unit extraction work. Previous session 
completed extraction and diary
  investigation for 83 missing records, but 3 dates remained ambiguous with 
medium confidence.

  Work Completed:

  1. Created Investigation Runsheet 
(outputs/ambiguous-dates-investigation-runsheet.md)
    - Extracted and translated Bulgarian diary entries for 2009-03-11 and 
2009-03-12 Team C
    - Full translations from C_Diary_BG.doc with archaeological context
    - March 11: 115-line diary entry documenting burial mound necropolis DS 052 
(3 mounds)
    - March 12: 57-line diary entry documenting ridge survey and mound work
    - April 5 Team B: No diary entries exist (12-day gap between sessions)
  2. User Investigation Results:
    - 2009-03-11 Team C: RESOLVED - Non-unit survey work (object recording). 
Daily Progress Form explicitly states "No
  intensive no extensive no mountain [survey]" - HIGH confidence
    - 2009-03-12 Team C: PENDING - Found OLD six-digit units 300003-300009 (skip
 300008). These were retroactively
  renumbered to five-digit 30xxx format. No simple mapping exists - requires 
investigation
    - 2009-04-05 Team B: RESOLVED - Units 20808-20812 found. Data entry error on
 form: recorder swapped Start/End Unit
  and Start/End Time fields - HIGH confidence
  3. Files Updated:
    - missing-survey-units-extracted.csv: Updated all 3 dates with findings
    - attribution.csv: Applied 20808-20812 to April 5 Team B, enhanced March 11 
Team C explanation
    - extraction-report.md: Added "Final Investigation" section with detailed 
findings
    - follow-up-actions.md: Added renumbering investigation task (Medium 
Priority #1) with full context
  4. Important Principle Reinforced:
    - Never delete completed tasks from to-do lists/checklists
    - Always mark as done (☑ or [x]) with completion dates instead
    - Preserve task history for audit trail

  Final Status:
  - Survey unit coverage: 239/268 (89.18%)
  - 54/83 original missing records extracted (65.1%)
  - 28/83 fully explained (33.7%)
  - 1/83 pending renumbering investigation (1.2%)
  - Next action: User investigating six-digit to five-digit unit number mapping 
for 2009-03-12 Team C (Kazanluk spring
  2009, old units 300003-300009)

  Key Files:
  - Investigation runsheet with Bulgarian translations and results: 
outputs/ambiguous-dates-investigation-runsheet.md
  - Renumbering task documented: outputs/follow-up-actions.md Medium Priority #1

> ok, let's do some housekeeping. Can you please look for documentation that
 needs updating and/or archiving, and make a plan to bring everything up to 
date? 

● I'll help you identify documentation that needs updating or archiving
  after the survey unit extraction project completion. Let me explore the
  codebase to assess the current state of documentation.

● Plan(Review documentation for housekeeping)
  ⎿  Done (17 tool uses · 103.3k tokens · 2m 2s)                           

● Based on the comprehensive documentation review, I can see there are
  several housekeeping tasks needed. Before I present a detailed plan, let
  me ask a few clarifying questions about your preferences:
                                                                           
● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What scope of housekeeping work would you like to complete now? → 
     Core updates only (update existing files, archive old reports)
     · Should I create new comprehensive documentation to mark project 
     completion? → This isn't a full project completion, it's just an 
     interim update after finishing the survey unit number extraction phase 
     - so survey unit *number* extraction report would be useful, plus an 
     incremental changelog.md update. Regarding readmes, update existing 
     ones as needed but don't do a comprehensive archive readme creation 
     sprint right now, put that on a to-do list for later

     · How should I handle the archive directory structure? → Create 
     structured archive with subdirectories
     · The six-digit unit renumbering task (2009-03-12 Team C) is currently 
     listed as Medium Priority in follow-up-actions.md. Should I adjust its 
     priority or status? → Keep as Medium Priority


                                                                           
● User approved Claude's plan
  ⎿  Documentation Housekeeping Plan - Survey Unit Extraction Phase 
     Completion

     Scope: Core updates following survey unit number extraction completion 
     (239/268, 89.18% coverage achieved 24 Nov 2025)

     Phase 1: Create Archive Structure and Move Files

     1. Create archive directories:
       - archive/reports/survey-unit-extraction/
       - archive/investigation-runsheets/
     2. Archive 5 interim/completed investigation documents from outputs/:
       - Move to archive/investigation-runsheets/:
           - missing-dates-diary-investigation.md (empty template, 
     superseded)
         - ambiguous-dates-investigation-runsheet.md (completed 24 Nov 2025)
       - Move to archive/reports/survey-unit-extraction/:
           - extraction-completion-summary.md (point-in-time, superseded)
         - missing-dates-final-summary.md (completed investigation)
         - missing-dates-investigation-findings.md (completed investigation)

     Phase 2: Update 6 Existing Files with Current Statistics

     3. README.md (root) - Minor updates:
       - Update completion date to show both: "23 November 2025 (walker 
     data), 24 November 2025 (survey units)"
       - Update survey unit coverage to 239/268 (89.18%)
       - Clarify that 29 records without units includes 28 explained + 1 
     pending renumbering
     4. outputs/follow-up-actions.md - Update header:
       - Line 6: Update survey unit status to "89.18% COMPLETE (239/268 with
      units, 28/268 explained, 1/268 pending renumbering)"
       - Keep six-digit renumbering task as Medium Priority (no changes to 
     that section)
     5. outputs/extraction-report.md - Final statistics:
       - Lines 10-14: Update summary to show 54 extracted (not 53), 1 
     pending
       - Lines 319-349: Update conclusion section to reflect final ambiguous
      dates investigation completion
       - Add reference to ambiguous-dates-investigation-runsheet.md (now 
     archived)
     6. outputs/extraction-completion-summary.md - Update if not being 
     archived separately (actually this is being archived, so skip)
       - CORRECTION: This file is being archived, so no update needed
     7. outputs/task-completion-final-summary.md - Update statistics:
       - Update survey unit extraction from 238/268 (88.81%) to 239/268 
     (89.18%)
       - Update "Successfully extracted" from 53 to 54 records
     8. planning/akb-submission-todo.md - Update Task 1 completion:
       - Lines 23-41: Update "Successfully extracted: 53/83" to "54/83 
     (65.1%)"
       - Update "Final coverage: 238/268 (88.81%)" to "239/268 (89.18%)"

     Phase 3: Create New Documentation

     9. Create outputs/survey-unit-number-extraction-report.md:
       - Executive summary: Survey unit NUMBER extraction phase completion
       - Phase results: 54 units extracted, 28 dates explained, 1 pending 
     renumbering
       - Methodology: Excel, Bulgarian diaries, PDF forms, diary 
     investigation, ambiguous date resolution
       - Statistics by team and year
       - Document six-digit to five-digit renumbering issue (2009-03-12 Team
      C)
       - References to archived investigation reports
     10. Update CHANGELOG.md - Add incremental milestone:
       - Add section for post-v1.0.0 work (v1.0.1 or just dated entry)
       - Document survey unit NUMBER extraction completion (24 Nov 2025)
       - Coverage improvement: 69% → 89.18%
       - Reference new survey-unit-number-extraction-report.md

     Phase 4: Update Follow-up Actions

     11. Add to outputs/follow-up-actions.md (Low Priority section):
       - New task: Create comprehensive archive README files for reports and
      investigation runsheets
       - Document what's archived, why, and how to navigate archived 
     documentation

     Summary of Changes

     - Files archived: 5 (interim reports and completed investigation 
     runsheets)
     - Files updated: 5 (README.md, follow-up-actions.md, 
     extraction-report.md, task-completion-final-summary.md, 
     akb-submission-todo.md)
     - Files created: 2 (survey-unit-number-extraction-report.md, archive 
     directories)
     - CHANGELOG updated: 1 incremental milestone added

     All statistics will be consistently updated to reflect final coverage: 
     239/268 (89.18%)

       77    ### Known Limitations
       78    1. **Role data incomplete:** PDA operator, paper recorder, 
            and other role fields have <50% coverage due to limited 
            source documentation
       79 -  2. **Survey units incomplete:** 18 records (6.7%) missing 
          - survey unit numbers (not present in source data)
       79 +  2. **Survey units incomplete:** 29 records (10.82%) without 
          + survey unit numbers: 28 records explained (alternative survey
          +  methodologies, weather cancellations, non-survey days), 1 
          + record pending renumbering investigation (six-digit to 
          + five-digit unit conversion)
       80    3. **Pre-FAIR project:** TRAP predates FAIR principles; this
             extraction applies retrospective data curation
       81

       192 +  ### Survey Unit Extraction Results
       193 +  
       194 +  **Extraction phase (54 records):**
       195 +  - Bulgarian field diaries (2009): 29 records extracted
       196 +  - PDF Daily Progress Forms (2009): 25 records extracted
       197 +  - Excel SurveySummary files: 0 records (fields empty for 
           + missing records)
       198 +  
       199 +  **Investigation phase (29 records):**
       200 +  - Alternative survey methods: 5 records (mound 
           + documentation, transect surveys, object recording)
       201 +  - No autumn survey seasons: 11 records (2009-2010 diaries 
           + end in March/April)
       202 +  - Weather cancellations: 3 records (rain days verified in 
           + diaries)
       203 +  - Non-survey activities: 3 records (base cleanup, remote 
           + sensing, grading)
       204 +  - Gap days: 3 records (between survey sessions)
       205 +  - Team not working: 3 records (no diary entries)
       206 +  - Pending investigation: 1 record (six-digit to five-digit 
           + unit renumbering for Team C 2009-03-12)
       207 +  
       208 +  ### Key Discoveries
       209 +  
       210 +  #### Alternative Survey Methodologies
       211 +  Investigation revealed that many "missing" survey units 
           + represent **legitimate alternative survey methods** rather 
           + than missing data:
       212 +  
       213 +  - **Team C specialisation:** Intensive site investigations 
           + (mound documentation, transect surveys, object recording) 
           + rather than systematic unit-based surveys
       214 +  - **Team C lower coverage explained:** 79.45% coverage due 
           + to focus on intensive archaeological recording rather than 
           + extensive survey
       215 +  - **Examples:** 2009-03-11 (burial mound necropolis DS 052 
           + with 3 mounds documented), 2009-03-25 (transect survey for 
           + site GCh-060), 2009-03-27 (9 mounds documented for site 
           + GCh-061)
       216 +  
       217 +  #### Six-Digit to Five-Digit Unit Renumbering Issue
       218 +  - **Discovery:** Old six-digit survey units (300003-300009,
           +  skip 300008) found on 2009-03-12 Team C Daily Progress Form
       219 +  - **Problem:** Team C initially used six-digit numbering 
           + (300xxx) later retroactively changed to five-digit (30xxx) 
           + format
       220 +  - **Status:** Pending investigation of GIS databases, unit 
           + cards, or project metadata for renumbering mapping
       221 +  - **Documented in:** outputs/follow-up-actions.md Medium 
           + Priority #1
       222 +  
       223 +  #### Data Entry Error Resolution
       224 +  - **2009-04-05 Team B:** PDF form had Start/End Unit and 
           + Start/End Time fields swapped - units 20808-20812 clearly 
           + visible in wrong fields, successfully extracted
       225 +  
       226 +  ### Data Quality Metrics (Post-v1.0.0 Update)

       239 +  
       240 +  ### Methodology
       241 +  
       242 +  **Text extraction:**
       243 +  - antiword for Bulgarian .doc files (Cyrillic script)
       244 +  - pandoc for English .docx files
       245 +  - Python regex for 5-digit unit number pattern matching
       246 +  
       247 +  **Vision-based extraction:**
       248 +  - Claude vision (multimodal LLM) for reading scanned PDF 
           + Daily Progress Forms
       249 +  - Manual transcription and validation
       250 +  
       251 +  **NLP analysis:**
       252 +  - Bulgarian diary translation and interpretation (~100+ 
           + pages examined)
       253 +  - Cross-referencing across 11 diary files (2009-2011)
       254 +  - Narrative analysis for alternative survey methods
       255 +  
       256 +  ### Outstanding Tasks
       257 +  
       258 +  From outputs/follow-up-actions.md:
       259 +  
       260 +  #### High Priority
       261 +  - Cascade Excel date corrections to other data copies
       262 +  - Participant list updates (Silvia Ivanova, Lizzy, Jiří 
           + Musil)
       263 +  
       264 +  #### Medium Priority
       265 +  - Six-digit to five-digit unit renumbering investigation 
           + (2009-03-12 Team C Kazanluk)
       266 +  - Review 12 failed diary extractions for alternative 
           + methods
       267 +  
       268 +  #### Low Priority
       269 +  - Create comprehensive archive README files (added 24 
           + November 2025)
       270 +  - Name format standardisation (full names vs initials)
       271 +  - Role field enhancement (if additional sources discovered)
       272 +

       311 +  
       312 +  **Status:** Pending
       313 +  
       314 +  **Context:** Following the 24 November 2025 housekeeping 
           + update, new archive directories were created with structured
           +  organisation:
       315 +  - `archive/investigation-runsheets/` - Completed 
           + investigation runsheets
       316 +  - `archive/reports/survey-unit-extraction/` - Interim 
           + survey unit extraction reports
       317 +  
       318 +  **Action required:**
       319 +  - [ ] Create `archive/investigation-runsheets/README.md`:
       320 +    - Explain purpose of runsheets (procedural documents for 
           + systematic investigation)
       321 +    - List archived runsheets with completion dates
       322 +    - Note that findings are incorporated into main 
           + extraction-report.md
       323 +  - [ ] Create 
           + `archive/reports/survey-unit-extraction/README.md`:
       324 +    - Catalogue archived survey unit extraction reports
       325 +    - Document timeline of reports (extraction → 
           + investigation → final)
       326 +    - Explain report supersession
       327 +    - Guide readers to which report to consult for what 
           + information
       328 +  
       329 +  **Note:** This task was deferred during the 24 November 
           + 2025 housekeeping to focus on core updates and archiving. 
           + Archive structure is in place; READMEs can be added 
           + incrementally.

  ✅ Created archive directories:
  - archive/reports/survey-unit-extraction/
  - archive/investigation-runsheets/

  ✅ Archived 5 files:
  - 2 investigation runsheets (completed investigations)
  - 3 interim survey unit extraction reports (superseded by final
  documentation)

  - Listed all 5 archived files with their new locations
  - Key discoveries section (alternative survey methodologies, six-digit
  renumbering)
  - Updated data quality metrics table with changes from v1.0.0
  - Methodology and provenance documentation

  Summary

  Files modified: 7
  Files created: 2
  Files archived: 5
  Archive directories created: 2

  All statistics now consistently show:
  - Walker data: 268/268 (100%)
  - Survey units: 239/268 (89.18%)
  - Completion dates: 23 Nov 2025 (walker), 24 Nov 2025 (survey units)
  - Documentation completeness: 100%

  Follow-up task added: Create comprehensive archive README files (Low
  Priority #7 in follow-up-actions.md) - deferred for incremental
  implementation

  The documentation is now fully up to date and consistent across all files,
   with interim reports properly archived and a comprehensive survey unit
  number extraction report documenting the phase completion.

> ok, looking at outputs/ I think I see more files that can be archived:\
\
- all-extracted-units.csv\
- various attribution backup.csvs\
- diary-extracted-units.csv\
- excel-extracted-units.csv\
- extraction-report.md\
- missing-survey-units-extracted.csv\
- survey-unit-coverage-report.txt\
- survey-unit-number-extracton-report.md\
\
I think these are all interim files that were specifically about unit number
 extraction? I could be wrong - push back if I am - but can't we archive 
these files? Do we still need any? Are any still active? 
  ⎿  Found 16 new diagnostic issues in 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Great question! You're mostly right, but let me push back on a couple of
  these:

  Should be Archived ✅

  1. all-extracted-units.csv - Interim working file combining Excel and
  diary extractions, superseded by attribution.csv
  2. diary-extracted-units.csv - Extraction phase working file, superseded
  3. excel-extracted-units.csv - Extraction phase working file, superseded
  4. survey-unit-coverage-report.txt - Static verification snapshot,
  superseded
  5. extraction-report.md - You're RIGHT about this one! This was the
  ongoing/working report throughout extraction. Now superseded by the new
  survey-unit-number-extraction-report.md
  6. attribution backup CSVs - Should go to archive/outputs/backups/ (not
  survey-unit-extraction/)

  Should NOT be Archived ❌

  1. missing-survey-units-extracted.csv - This is still ACTIVE! It's
  referenced in follow-up-actions.md Medium Priority #1 (six-digit
  renumbering task): "Update outputs/missing-survey-units-extracted.csv with
   converted units". This tracking file will be updated when the renumbering
   investigation completes.
  2. survey-unit-number-extraction-report.md - This is the NEW comprehensive
   completion report I just created. Definitely keep active!

  Suggested Archive Structure

  archive/reports/survey-unit-extraction/
  ├── extraction-report.md (ongoing working report)
  ├── all-extracted-units.csv
  ├── diary-extracted-units.csv
  ├── excel-extracted-units.csv
  └── survey-unit-coverage-report.txt

  archive/outputs/backups/
  └── [all attribution*.csv backup files]

  So yes, you're right to identify these as archival candidates! The only
  one to keep active is missing-survey-units-extracted.csv because it's
  still needed for the pending renumbering investigation.

  Should I proceed with archiving these 5 files (plus moving backups)?

> thank you, that's exactly the feedback I needed, please proceed, retaining
 the two files you flagged as 'active' in outputs/

● Perfect! All archiving complete. Here's what was done:

  Files Archived to archive/reports/survey-unit-extraction/

  ✅ 5 interim working files moved:
  1. all-extracted-units.csv - Combined extraction working file
  2. diary-extracted-units.csv - Diary extraction phase file
  3. excel-extracted-units.csv - Excel extraction phase file
  4. survey-unit-coverage-report.txt - Static verification snapshot
  5. extraction-report.md - Ongoing working report (superseded by
  survey-unit-number-extraction-report.md)

  Files Archived to archive/outputs/backups/

  ✅ 3 attribution backup CSV files moved:
  1. attribution-pre-explanations-backup.csv
  2. attribution-pre-final-updates-backup.csv
  3. attribution-pre-update-backup.csv

  Active Files Retained in outputs/

  ✅ 2 files confirmed in place:
  1. missing-survey-units-extracted.csv (9.0K) - ACTIVE tracking file for
  renumbering investigation
  2. survey-unit-number-extraction-report.md (22K) - NEW comprehensive
  completion report

  The outputs/ directory is now much cleaner with only active documentation
  and the main attribution.csv file. All interim working files and backups
  are properly archived with clear provenance.
