       288 +  ### D015: 2009-10-21, Team A — Start Unit Discrepancy
       289 +  
       290 +  **Type:** Unit number error
       291 +  
       292 +  | Source | Value |
       293 +  |--------|-------|
       294 +  | Diary (Diary Team A.doc) | Start: **60196**, End: 60273 |
       295 +  | CSV (current) | Start: 60195, End: 60273 |
       296 +  
       297 +  **Resolution:** Correct Start Unit from 60195 to 60196
       298 +  
       299 +  **Reasoning:** Diary unit summary table clearly states 
           + "First unit: 60196". This creates a single-unit gap (60195) 
           + between Oct 20 (ends 60194) and Oct 21 (starts 60196). The 
           + diary is authoritative — the gap may represent a skipped or 
           + reassigned unit.

           + Substitution Not Reflected
       304 +  
       305 +  **Type:** Personnel error (4 records)

       307 +  **Affected dates:** 2009-10-26, 2009-10-27, 2009-10-28,

       312 +  | Walkers_Full | ...Erik Andersen | ...Tereza Dobrovodská |
       313 +  
       314 +  **Diary evidence:**
       315 +  - Oct 25 (Edirne excursion): "Eric decided to go on to 
           + Istanbul and is dropped off at the busstation near the main 
           + mosque parting with our team."
       316 +  - Oct 26: "Team A comprises Adela, Ilija, Aneta, Martin and
           +  **Tereza as a substitute for Eric**."
       317 +  - Oct 27: "Team A in Monday set up" (refers to Oct 26 
           + composition with Tereza)
       318 +  - Nov 1: "I get up at 5.30 to take Vera and Terka to the 
           + bus station" (Terka = Tereza leaving)
       319 +  
       320 +  **Resolution:** Replace Eric/Erik Andersen with 
           + Tereza/Tereza Dobrovodská in Walkers_Raw and Walkers_Full 
           + for all 4 records.

           + diaries end in March/April"
       332 +  
       333 +  **Resolution:** Remove this erroneous statement from 
           + QA_Notes
       334 +  
       335 +  **Reasoning:** The Diary Team A.doc comprehensively covers 
           + 10 October through 21 November 2009 with detailed daily 
           + entries. These non-survey days are explicitly documented 
           + (rain for Oct 30 and Nov 4, Halloween for Oct 31). The 
           + statement is factually incorrect.

                         |

  Notable Discovery: Eric→Tereza Substitution

  The diary documents that Eric departed for Istanbul during the Edirne
  excursion on Oct 25. Tereza Dobrovodská substituted for him on Oct 26-29.
  The CSV incorrectly still shows Eric/Erik Andersen for those dates.

  Diary evidence:
  - Oct 25: "Eric decided to go on to Istanbul and is dropped off at the
  busstation"
  - Oct 26: "Team A comprises Adela, Ilija, Aneta, Martin and Tereza as a 
  substitute for Eric"

  Unit Continuity

  Near-perfect. One single-unit gap (60195) between Oct 20 and Oct 21 — the
  diary explicitly states Oct 21 starts at 60196, not 60195. This may
  represent a skipped or reassigned unit.

  Output Files

  - Runsheet: outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2009-autumn-a.md
  - Discrepancies: Updated docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md with D015-D018

  Pending Your Approval

  9 corrections across 9 records:
  1. D015: Oct 21 start unit 60195→60196
  2. D016: Oct 26-29 walkers: Eric→Tereza (4 records × 2 fields)
  3. D017: Remove erroneous QA_Notes from Oct 30, 31, Nov 4
  4. D018: Add Diary_Source to Nov 9

  Shall I apply these corrections, or would you like to review the runsheet
  first?

> I'll review the run-sheet and confirm corrections there - while I do that,
 could you find and check the Survey Unit form and see if you can resolve 
the single-unit gap? I have found the answer, but want to see if you can as 
a test of the value of examining scanned SU forms..

  - Top form (4th): Survey unit field is BLANK (form prepared but not
  completed)

  Finding: Unit 60195 was never used!

  The SU forms show that after unit 60194 (the last completed unit on Oct
  20), there are blank forms — forms that were prepared but never filled in.
   This explains the gap perfectly:

  - Oct 20 ended at unit 60194 ✓
  - Unit 60195 form was prepared but skipped/not used
  - Oct 21 started at unit 60196 (as the diary states) ✓

  Resolution: The diary is correct. Unit 60195 was allocated but never
  surveyed — likely the form was prepared in anticipation but the team
  finished for the day before needing it. The CSV value of 60195 is wrong;
  the diary's 60196 is correct.

  This is a great example of where the SU forms provide definitive primary 
  evidence that resolves an apparent discrepancy. The blank form proves the
  unit was skipped, not that the diary made an error.

  Should I update D015 in the discrepancies log to note this SU form
  evidence?

> '/home/shawn/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2025-11-26 20-59-32.png'
 please look at this screenshot and tell me what you see. 

● This changes everything! Looking at your screenshot:

  Survey Unit Form shows:
  - Date: 21 (October 2009)
  - Survey unit: 60.195
  - Walk interval: 10m
  - Walker position box: 1. Marti(n), 2. Cueli(?), 3. adela, 4. [?], 5. Eric

  This proves the CSV is CORRECT and the diary is WRONG!

  Unit 60195 was surveyed on October 21, not skipped. The diary's "First
  unit: 60196" is a transcription error.

  Revised resolution for D015:
  - CSV Start Unit: 60195 ✓ CORRECT (SU form confirms)
  - Diary "First unit: 60196" — transcription error
  - No correction needed — the CSV already has the right value

  This beautifully demonstrates the value of SU forms as the definitive
  primary source. The diary was written later from memory/notes and
  introduced an error. The SU form, filled in the field at the time of
  survey, is authoritative.

  Shall I update the runsheet and discrepancies log to reflect this? D015
  should be removed from the corrections list since the CSV is already
  correct.

> Yes, I would like you to correct the run sheet and note the error in the 
diary. I'd also like to investigate why you had difficulty locating this 
information yourself - I have some ideas, but what is your self-diagnosis? 

● Good question. Let me update the runsheet first, then provide my
  self-diagnosis.

        83 +  **Resolution:** No correction required — CSV value 60195 is
           +  correct
        84    
        85 -  **Reasoning:** Diary unit summary table clearly states 
           - "First unit: 60196". This is a single-unit extraction error.
           -  Unit continuity check: Oct 20 ends at 60194, so Oct 21 
           - should start at 60195 (Oct 20 end + 1). However, the diary 
           - explicitly states 60196. The diary is authoritative.
        85 +  **SU Form Evidence:**
        86 +  The SU form for unit 60195 (page 56 of field records) 
           + clearly shows:
        87    
        88 -  **Note:** This creates a gap of one unit (60195) between 
           - Oct 20 and Oct 21. This may indicate unit 60195 was skipped 
           - or reassigned. The diary is the primary source.
        88 +  - **Date:** 21 October 2009
        89 +  - **Survey unit:** 60.195
        90 +  - **Walk interval:** 10m
        91 +  - **Walkers:** Martin, [unclear], Adela, [unclear], Eric
        92    
        93 +  This definitively proves unit 60195 was surveyed on 21 
           + October, not skipped.
        94 +  
        95 +  **Diary Error Analysis:**
        96 +  The diary's "First unit: 60196" is a transcription error 
           + made when Adela compiled the unit summary table after 
           + fieldwork. The SU form, completed in the field at the time 
           + of survey, is the authoritative primary source.
        97 +  
        98 +  **Lesson:** SU forms take precedence over diary summary 
           + tables for unit numbers. Diaries are secondary sources for 
           + numeric data, subject to transcription errors.

  Self-Diagnosis: Why I Failed to Find Unit 60195

  What I Did Wrong

  1. File naming assumption error: I assumed 60192.pdf would contain units
  after 60192 (i.e., 60192-60195+). In reality, the PDF naming convention
  appears to indicate a batch reference or starting point, and the actual
  content structure was different. The file contained units from Oct 20
  (60127-60194 range), not the Oct 21 units I needed.
  2. Didn't list all available PDFs: I found 60192.pdf and stopped looking.
  I should have run:
  ls FieldRecords/*.pdf | sort
  2. to see all available files and identify which one might contain Oct 21
  data.
  3. Misinterpreted blank forms as evidence: On page 17 of 60192.pdf, I saw
  forms with blank/unclear unit numbers after 60194 and jumped to the
  conclusion that unit 60195 was "skipped." This was confirmation bias — I
  found evidence that seemed to support the diary and stopped searching.
  4. Didn't search for unit 60195 specifically: I could have used grep or
  searched for a PDF file containing "60195" or checked if there was a file
  like 60196.pdf or similar that would contain the Oct 21 forms.
  5. Page count mismatch: The PDF I examined had 18 pages. Your screenshot
  shows page 56. This means either:
    - There's a larger consolidated PDF I didn't find
    - The file I read was incomplete
    - There are multiple PDF files that form a series

  What I Should Have Done

  1. List all SU form PDFs and examine their naming pattern
  2. Search multiple files rather than assuming one file would contain the
  relevant unit
  3. Question my initial finding — when I saw "blank forms," I should have
  verified by checking other files rather than concluding the unit was
  skipped
  4. Cross-reference with the diary date — look for Oct 21 forms
  specifically, not just units near 60194

  Root Cause

  Over-reliance on a single source + confirmation bias. Once the diary said
  "60196" and I found what looked like blank forms after 60194, I accepted
  the diary as correct instead of exhaustively searching for contradicting
  evidence.

> Yes, I also noticed that the naming convention for these files 
is...difficult to understand (I can't decipher it!). Most other seasons are 
better, named by date, but this season is difficult. The solution is to read
 one or two pages from each file and identify the date, then dive deeper on 
the dates in question. Since these files are not OCRed, grep or similar 
would not have worked - only manual reading on your part would work. Page 
numbering is also strange, I think it's continuous from the beginning of the
 season, you can't rely on page counts. Look, this is a difficult case, it 
took me several tries to find the answer. The way I would approach survey 
unit number gaps (i.e., the protocol I'd record in the QA approach) would be
 (a) look for survey units based on the filename *if* the filename contains 
the date, (b) if the filename does not contain the date, manually read one 
or more pages from the pdf until you identify the date of the file; repeat 
until you find the two dates where there is a gap, overlap, or other 
problem, (c) after you have it narrowed down to one or two files, 
*carefully* read those file *with an open mind* (you don't know whether the 
gap / overlap / other problem is real or not!) and find the first / last SU 
number, noting that the pages may not be in order so you have to read all 
the way through. I know this is labour-intensive, so I would *only* initiate
 it if there is a gap, overlap, or other obvious problem that can't be 
solved from diaries + daily progress forms (as in this case, where there are
 not DPFs. What do you think of this approach? Can you think of improvements
 to it? 

● Your proposed approach is sound and practical. Here's my analysis:

  Your Protocol — Strengths

  1. Conditional triggering — Only invoke this labour-intensive process when
   there's an unresolvable gap/overlap. Smart resource allocation.
  2. Open mind requirement — Critical. My failure was treating the diary as
  "probably right" rather than treating it as an unverified claim.
  3. Non-sequential page warning — Important. I assumed page order = unit
  order, which may not hold.

  Suggested Improvements

  1. Create an SU Form Index (Once Per Season)

  When you first encounter a difficult season, document the file→date
  mapping:

  | File | Date Range | Unit Range | Notes |
  |------|------------|------------|-------|
  | 60192.pdf | Oct 20 | 60127-60194 | Batch name unclear |
  | ???.pdf | Oct 21 | 60195-60273 | |

  This pays dividends if you revisit the season.

  2. Systematic Sampling Protocol

  Rather than "read until you find the date," sample:
  - First form on page 1
  - A form from the middle
  - Last form on final page

  This gives you date range coverage quickly.

  3. Trust Continuity as a Prior

  In this case, the CSV already had the continuity-preserving value (60195).
   I should have been more skeptical of the diary, not the CSV. A better
  heuristic:

  When diary disagrees with CSV on unit numbers and CSV maintains 
  continuity, assume CSV is correct unless SU forms prove otherwise.

  4. Record Negative Findings

  Had I written: "Searched 60192.pdf (18 pages), covers Oct 20, units 
  60127-60194. Unit 60195 not found — need to locate Oct 21 file." — I would
   have recognised my search was incomplete.

  5. Flag Difficult Seasons in Source Inventory

  Note in source-inventory.md:

  ELH 2009 SU Forms: File naming does not follow date convention. Manual 
  date identification required. Page numbers are season-continuous.

  ---
  Should I draft this as an addendum to qa-guidance.md under the SU Forms
  section?

> (1) great idea; (2) In this case, each file is one day, but *you are 
correct* and that may not always be the case, sampling early / middle / late
 is a very good idea; (3) reasonable heuristic (trust CSV) but also be ready
 for contrary evidence and do an honest search / assessment; (4) perfect, 
yes, if you can condition yourself to that way of thinking / writing, it 
would improve results; (5) yes! any additional information you can provide 
about sources in the inventory will be a great help later - recall that we 
will be doing additional data work so this effort is not wasted. Please 
draft your addendum to qa-guidance.md; I will continue reviewing the 
runsheet.

       483    
       484    For seasons like **Elhovo 2009** where no DPF scans exist, 
             SU forms become the **only primary field source** to 
             cross-verify unit numbers against diary entries. The unit 
             number on each SU form is recorded in the field at the time 
             of survey, making it definitive.
       485    
       486 +  ### Protocol: Investigating Unit Gaps/Overlaps with SU 
           + Forms
       487 +  
       488 +  This protocol applies when unit continuity analysis reveals
           +  a gap, overlap, or other discrepancy that cannot be 
           + resolved from diaries and DPF scans alone. It is 
           + **labour-intensive** — only invoke when necessary.
       489 +  
       490 +  **Trigger conditions:**
       491 +  
       492 +  - Unit gap > 1 between consecutive survey days
       493 +  - Unit overlap (same unit on different days)
       494 +  - Diary and CSV disagree on Start/End Unit
       495 +  
       496 +  #### Step 1: Assess the Situation
       497 +  
       498 +  Before diving into SU forms, consider:
       499 +  
       500 +  1. **Does the CSV maintain continuity?** If CSV is 
           + continuous but diary claims a gap, the diary may have a 
           + transcription error. Approach with an open mind — either 
           + could be correct.
       501 +  
       502 +  2. **Is there a DPF scan?** Check first; DPF scans are 
           + easier to read than SU forms.
       503 +  
       504 +  3. **What is the exact discrepancy?** Document precisely: 
           + "Diary says Oct 21 starts at 60196; CSV says 60195; Oct 20 
           + ends at 60194."
       505 +  
       506 +  #### Step 2: Locate Relevant SU Form Files
       507 +  
       508 +  1. **List all SU form PDFs** for the team/season:
       509 +  
       510 +     ```bash
       511 +     ls -la "[Team]/FieldRecords/*.pdf"
       512 +     ```
       513 +  
       514 +  2. **Check filename convention:**
       515 +     - Some seasons use date-based naming (e.g., `Oct21.pdf`)
           +  — use these directly
       516 +     - Some seasons use unit-based or batch naming (e.g., 
           + `60192.pdf`) — requires manual investigation
       517 +  
       518 +  3. **If filenames do not contain dates:** You must sample 
           + each file to identify date coverage.
       519 +  
       520 +  #### Step 3: Sample Files to Identify Date Coverage
       521 +  
       522 +  For each PDF file with unclear naming:
       523 +  
       524 +  1. **Read the first form** (page 1, bottom form) — note the
           +  date and unit number
       525 +  2. **Read a middle form** (mid-document) — note the date
       526 +  3. **Read the last form** (final page, top form) — note the
           +  date and unit number
       527 +  
       528 +  Create an SU Form Index:
       529 +  
       530 +  ```markdown
       531 +  | File | First Date | Last Date | Unit Range | Pages |
       532 +  |------|------------|-----------|------------|-------|
       533 +  | 60192.pdf | Oct 20 | Oct 20 | 60127-60194 | 18 |
       534 +  | [next file] | ... | ... | ... | ... |
       535 +  ```
       536 +  
       537 +  **Record this index** in source-inventory.md for future 
           + reference — this effort should not be repeated.
       538 +  
       539 +  #### Step 4: Narrow Down to Relevant Files
       540 +  
       541 +  Using your index, identify which file(s) should contain the
           +  disputed units:
       542 +  
       543 +  - For a gap between Oct 20 (ends 60194) and Oct 21 (starts 
           + 60195 or 60196?), find the file covering Oct 21
       544 +  
       545 +  #### Step 5: Careful Reading with Open Mind
       546 +  
       547 +  **Critical:** Do not assume you know the answer. Either the
           +  diary or the CSV could be correct.
       548 +  
       549 +  1. **Read the relevant file thoroughly** — pages may not be
           +  in order
       550 +  2. **Find the specific unit(s) in question** — e.g., look 
           + for unit 60195
       551 +  3. **Note the date on that form** — this is the definitive 
           + answer
       552 +  4. **Record walker names** if relevant to other 
           + discrepancies
       553 +  
       554 +  #### Step 6: Document Findings
       555 +  
       556 +  Whether the SU form confirms or refutes your initial 
           + assumption:
       557 +  
       558 +  1. **Update the discrepancy log** with SU form evidence
       559 +  2. **Note the file, page, and specific data** found
       560 +  3. **If diary was wrong:** Document as "Diary transcription
           +  error — SU form confirms [value]"
       561 +  4. **If CSV was wrong:** Document correction needed
       562 +  
       563 +  #### Step 7: Update Source Inventory
       564 +  
       565 +  Add any newly discovered file-to-date mappings to 
           + `source-inventory.md`:
       566 +  
       567 +  ```markdown
       568 +  **ELH 2009 SU Forms:** File naming does not follow date 
           + convention.
       569 +  Manual date identification required. Page numbers are 
           + season-continuous.
       570 +  
       571 +  | File | Date(s) | Unit Range |
       572 +  |------|---------|------------|
       573 +  | 60192.pdf | Oct 20 | 60127-60194 |
       574 +  ```
       575 +  
       576 +  ### Lessons Learned: SU Form Investigation
       577 +  
       578 +  **From D015 (Elhovo 2009 Team A, Oct 21):**
       579 +  
       580 +  The diary stated "First unit: 60196" but the CSV had 60195.
           +  Initial QA assumed the diary was correct based on:
       581 +  
       582 +  - Blank forms observed after unit 60194 in one PDF file
       583 +  - Confirmation bias — evidence was interpreted as 
           + supporting the diary
       584 +  
       585 +  **Resolution:** User-directed SU form review found unit 
           + 60195 on a form dated 21 October, proving:
       586 +  
       587 +  - CSV value (60195) was **correct**
       588 +  - Diary value (60196) was a **transcription error**
       589 +  
       590 +  **Key lessons:**
       591 +  
       592 +  1. **Trust continuity as a prior** — CSV value 60195 
           + maintained unit continuity; diary value created a gap
       593 +  2. **Search exhaustively** — the relevant form was in a 
           + different file than initially examined
       594 +  3. **Record negative findings** — "File X does not contain 
           + unit Y" is useful information
       595 +  4. **Keep an open mind** — do not assume diary is correct; 
           + SU forms are the primary field record
       596 +

       241 +  File naming convention is **unclear** — filenames appear to

● Done. I've made three updates:

  1. qa-guidance.md — New Protocol Section

  Added "Protocol: Investigating Unit Gaps/Overlaps with SU Forms" with:
  - Trigger conditions (when to invoke)
  - 7-step process (assess → locate files → sample → narrow down → careful
  reading → document → update inventory)
  - Emphasis on "open mind" approach
  - Lessons Learned section documenting D015 as a case study

  2. qa-guidance.md — Lessons Learned

  Documented the D015 failure mode:
  - Confirmation bias
  - Incomplete search
  - Key lessons: trust continuity, search exhaustively, record negative
  findings, keep open mind

  3. source-inventory.md — ELH 2009 Warning

  Added to Tier 4 section:
  - ⚠️ warning about unclear file naming
  - Specific notes: no date convention, season-continuous page numbers
  - Started a file-to-date index (with 60192.pdf as first entry)
  - Cross-reference to qa-guidance.md protocol

  ---
  The key improvement is that future QA work on ELH 2009 will:
  1. See the warning immediately in source-inventory.md
  2. Know to consult the protocol in qa-guidance.md
  3. Build on the partial index rather than starting from scratch

  Let me know when you've finished reviewing the runsheet and are ready for
  the remaining corrections (D016-D018).

> with the runsheet, you seem to have stopped providing the one-sentence 
summary of the problem, plus a place for me to respond (e.g., 'appropve' vs.
 'modify'). Have you made a template for this? I'd suggest doing so to avoid
 omissions. Otherwise, I do approve the changes, they are all 
strightforward, but including the brief problem statement, resolution 
proposal, and approve/modify space for review will be crucial when we hit 
harder problems. 

● You're absolutely right — I got sloppy. The template exists in
  qa-guidance.md but I didn't follow it consistently. Let me create a
  standalone template file for easy reference and update the runsheet with
  proper approval blocks.

       105 -  **Type:** Personnel error (4 records)

       141    
       142 -  **Type:** Metadata error (3 records)
       142 +  **Problem:** QA_Notes incorrectly state "No autumn 2009

           + factually wrong.
       143    
       144 -  **Affected dates:** 2009-10-30, 2009-10-31, 2009-11-04

       150 -  **Reasoning:** The Diary Team A.doc comprehensively covers 
           - 10 October through 21 November 2009 with detailed daily 
           - entries and unit summary tables. The statement is factually 
           - incorrect — the diary explicitly documents autumn 2009 
           - activities including these non-survey days with specific 
           - evidence (rain, Halloween, etc.).
       150 +  **Evidence:**
