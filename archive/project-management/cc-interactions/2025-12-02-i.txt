> Did you complete the operations that were ongoing before the compact? 

● Let me check the current state to see what was completed before the
  compact:

● Bash(git status)
  ⎿  On branch master                               
     Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

     index 3d31d0d..d9ee4a7 100644
     --- a/outputs/attribution.csv
     … +29 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The CSV correction for KAZ09A (End Unit 10387 → 10385) was applied but not
   yet committed. Let me check if follow-up-actions.md was updated:

● Search(pattern: "KAZ09A", path: "planning/follow-up-actions.md", output_mode:
        "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● The KAZ09A resolution was not documented in follow-up-actions.md. I need
  to:
  1. Update follow-up-actions.md with the KAZ09A overlap resolution
  2. Commit and push all changes

  Let me read the relevant section of follow-up-actions.md:

● Search(pattern: "Resolved Overlaps|Kazanlak A.*10386", path:
        "planning/follow-up-actions.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 11 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(planning/follow-up-actions.md)
  ⎿  Read 80 lines

● Now I'll complete the pending work. Let me:
  1. Add the KAZ09A-OV1 resolution documentation
  2. Update the overlap table row
  3. Update the header count

● Update(planning/follow-up-actions.md)

● Summary: Yes, the pending operations are now complete.

  The context compact interrupted before I could finish documenting and
  committing. I've now completed:

  1. CSV correction (was applied but not committed):
    - Kazanlak A 2009-03-19: End Unit 10387 → 10385
  2. Documentation (added to follow-up-actions.md):
    - New section: KAZ09A-OV1 resolution details
    - Updated overlap table row to show RESOLVED status
    - Updated header count: 3 resolved (was 2)
  3. Committed and pushed (fd072bb)

  Status of overlap investigations:
  - 1 confirmed error: ELH10A (unit 61549 duplicated) - action needed
  - 3 resolved: ELH09C, KAZ10D, KAZ09A
  - 5 under investigation: KAZ09B, KAZ09C (2 issues), KAZ11C, KAZ09D

  Would you like to continue investigating the remaining 5 overlaps?

> you were also investigating why during the QA run that guidence from the 
guidelines (that DPF supercede diaries for unit numbers) was not followed. 

● You're right. Let me check what the guidelines actually say about source
  hierarchy:

● Search(pattern: "supersede|hierarchy|priority|DPF.*diary|diary.*DPF", path:
        "docs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(docs/qa-guidance.md)
  ⎿  Read 693 lines

● I see the issue now. The guidelines have clear rules, but there's a
  nuanced section that may have been misapplied. Let me check the KAZ09A QA
  runsheet to see what reasoning was used:

● Search(pattern: "D006|10387|10385|Mar.*19", path:
        "outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2009-spring-a.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "D006", path: "outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2009-spring-a.md",
         output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

● Read(outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2009-spring-a.md)
  ⎿  Read 282 lines

● Found the issue. Looking at lines 104-109 and the Source Divergences table
   (lines 225-229):

  What the QA runsheet did:
  - Correctly identified: DPF = 10385, Diary = 10387, CSV followed diary
  - Status: CONFIRMED (minor DPF/diary unit divergence)
  - Noted in Source Divergences table: Resolution: Diary/CSV with Minor 
  2-unit difference
  - Did NOT flag as a correction

  What the guidelines say:
  - Line 27: "DPF scans — PRIMARY source; more accurate for numeric/factual
  data"
  - Line 38: "DPF scans take precedence for basic info when conflicting with
   diaries"
  - Lines 56-60 (Cross-Check rule): "If diary creates a gap/overlap but DPF
  scan doesn't → confirms DPF scan as PRIMARY"

  The failure:
  In this case, DPF value (10385) creates continuity (10385 → 10386), while
  diary value (10387) creates a 2-unit overlap. The Cross-Check rule
  explicitly says this confirms DPF should be used. The QA process treated
  it as "minor" rather than applying the correction.

  Let me add this analysis to follow-up-actions.md and suggest a guideline
  clarification:

       619 +  ## QA Process Lessons Learned
       620 +  
       621 +  ### Issue: DPF vs Diary Source Priority Not Consistently 
           + Applied
       622 +  
       623 +  **Discovered:** 2 December 2025 during overlap 
           + investigation
       624 +  
       625 +  **Case study: KAZ09A-OV1 (Kazanlak A, 2009-03-19)**
       626 +  
       627 +  The QA runsheet documented a source divergence:
       628 +  - DPF: End Unit = 10385
       629 +  - Diary: End Unit = 10387
       630 +  - CSV followed diary value (10387)
       631 +  
       632 +  The runsheet noted this as "minor DPF/diary unit 
           + divergence" with status CONFIRMED, but did **not** flag it 
           + as a correction.
       633 +  
       634 +  **What went wrong:**
       635 +  
       636 +  1. The guidelines (qa-guidance.md) clearly state:
       637 +     - Line 27: "DPF scans — PRIMARY source; more accurate 
           + for numeric/factual data"
       638 +     - Line 38: "DPF scans take precedence for basic info 
           + when conflicting with diaries"
       639 +     - Line 174 (O1): "Always prefer DPF scan for Start Unit 
           + / End Unit values"
       640 +  
       641 +  2. The Cross-Check rule (lines 56-60) states: "If diary 
           + creates a gap/overlap but DPF scan doesn't → confirms DPF 
           + scan as PRIMARY"
       642 +  
       643 +  3. In this case:
       644 +     - DPF value (10385) creates continuity: Mar 19 ends at 
           + 10385 → Mar 20 starts at 10386 ✓
       645 +     - Diary value (10387) creates overlap: Mar 19 ends at 
           + 10387 but Mar 20 starts at 10386 ✗
       646 +  
       647 +  4. The Cross-Check rule should have confirmed DPF as 
           + correct, but instead the diary value was kept.
       648 +  
       649 +  **Root cause:** QA process treated DPF/diary divergences as
           +  "minor" informational notes rather than applying the 
           + mandatory source priority rule.
       650 +  
       651 +  **Recommended guideline updates:**
       652 +  
       653 +  1. **Make source priority mandatory, not advisory:** Change
           +  wording from "DPF scans take precedence" to "DPF scans 
           + **must** be used for unit numbers when they conflict with 
           + diaries"
       654 +  
       655 +  2. **Flag divergences as issues:** Any DPF/diary divergence
           +  for Start/End Units should generate a QA issue requiring 
           + resolution, not just a note in the Source Divergences table
       656 +  
       657 +  3. **Add explicit decision tree:**
       658 +     ```
       659 +     For Start_Unit / End_Unit conflicts:
       660 +     1. Check if DPF value maintains unit continuity with 
           + adjacent days
       661 +     2. Check if diary value maintains unit continuity
       662 +     3. If DPF maintains continuity and diary doesn't → USE 
           + DPF (mandatory)
       663 +     4. If both maintain continuity → USE DPF (per source 
           + priority)
       664 +     5. If neither maintains continuity → FLAG for SU form 
           + verification
       665 +     ```
       666 +  
       667 +  4. **Require explicit source attribution:** Each corrected 
           + value should note which source it came from (e.g., "End 
           + Unit: 10385 (from DPF; diary had 10387)")
       668 +  
       669 +  **Action items:**
       670 +  - [ ] Update qa-guidance.md with clearer mandatory language
       671 +  - [ ] Add decision tree for DPF/diary conflicts
       672 +  - [ ] Review other QA runsheets for similar "minor 
           + divergence" cases that should have been corrections
       673 +  
       674 +  ---
       675 +  
       676    ## Completed Actions
       677    
       678    - [x] Extract Kazanlak 2009 team compositions from diaries

● Now let me commit this documentation:

● Bash(git add planning/follow-up-actions.md && git commit -m "docs(qa):
      document QA process failure for DPF/diary source priority…)
  ⎿ [master 2172020] docs(qa): document QA process failure for DPF/diary so
    urce priority
     1 file changed, 57 insertions(+)


● Bash(git push)
  ⎿  To github.com:saross/trap-extraction.git
        fd072bb..2172020  master -> master

● Done. I've documented the QA process failure analysis in
  follow-up-actions.md.

  Summary of findings:

  The QA runsheet for KAZ09A (line 108-109) correctly identified the
  DPF/diary divergence but treated it as informational rather than
  actionable:
  - DPF: 10385 (creates continuity)
  - Diary: 10387 (creates 2-unit overlap)
  - Status: "CONFIRMED (minor DPF/diary unit divergence)"

  Root cause: The guidelines have the right rules (DPF is PRIMARY for unit
  numbers), but the QA process interpreted "precedence" as advisory rather
  than mandatory when the diary seemed plausible.

  Added to follow-up-actions.md:
  - Case study analysis with line references to qa-guidance.md
  - Explanation of what went wrong
  - 4 recommended guideline updates:
    a. Make source priority mandatory, not advisory
    b. Flag divergences as issues, not notes
    c. Add explicit decision tree for DPF/diary conflicts
    d. Require source attribution in corrections
  - Action items to update guidelines and review other runsheets

  Would you like me to implement the guideline updates to qa-guidance.md
  now, or continue with the remaining overlap investigations?

> let's update the guidance now. The more nuanced guidence is: for unit 
numbers and walker names, DPFs supercede diaries UNLESS they produce a 
discontinuity or an unexpected walker (compared to previous and succeedign 
day and 'usual' team composition, or producing a disallowed placement of one
 person on two teams on the same day) with no explanation articulated in the
 diary for such a change. When something unexpected (out of sequence unit 
number or disallowed / unexpected name) occurs, then the dairy and DPF 
should be consulted together to see if a solution that is attested in one or
 the other AND produces unit continuity and explanable walker identities can
 be deduced. If not, show me the evidence and I will look at the survey unit
 forms to come to a conclusion. 

● I'll update the qa-guidance.md with this more nuanced guidance. Let me
  find the relevant sections:

● Read(docs/qa-guidance.md)
  ⎿  Read 45 lines

● Now I'll rewrite the Source Priority Rules section with the nuanced

          -  context
       29 -  3. **Both together** — Required for high confidence
       27 +  **For unit numbers and walker names:** DPF scans supersede 
          + diaries by default.
       28    
       29 -  ### For Role Information (PDA, GPS, Paper Recorder, etc.)
       29 +  **For role information (PDA, GPS, Paper Recorder, etc.):** 
          + Diaries are PRIMARY and often the ONLY source. DPF scans do 
          + NOT reliably indicate roles (see O3 below).
       30    
       31 -  1. **Diaries** — PRIMARY and often ONLY source for role 
          - assignments
       32 -  2. **DPF scans** — Do NOT reliably indicate Paper Recorder 
          - (see O3 below)
       31 +  ### When DPF Priority Does NOT Apply
       32    
       33 -  ### Conflict Resolution
       33 +  DPF values should NOT be automatically preferred when they 
          + produce **unexpected results** with no explanation in the 
          + diary:
       34    
       35 -  - DPF scans take precedence for basic info when conflicting 
          - with diaries
       36 -  - Document all conflicts in discrepancies log with reasoning
       37 -  - Flag genuinely ambiguous cases for user decision
       35 +  1. **Unit discontinuity:** DPF value creates a gap or 
          + overlap with adjacent days
       36 +  2. **Unexpected walker:** DPF walker list differs from 
          + previous/succeeding days or "usual" team composition without 
          + explanation
       37 +  3. **Disallowed placement:** DPF would place the same person
          +  on two teams on the same day
       38    
       39 +  ### Conflict Resolution Decision Tree
       40 +  
       41 +  When DPF and diary conflict for unit numbers or walker 
          + names:
       42 +  
       43 +  ```text
       44 +  1. Does the DPF value produce continuity AND expected 
          + walkers?
       45 +     YES → Use DPF value (default priority applies)
       46 +     NO  → Continue to step 2
       47 +  
       48 +  2. Does the diary value produce continuity AND expected 
          + walkers?
       49 +     YES → Use diary value (DPF likely has recording error)
       50 +     NO  → Continue to step 3
       51 +  
       52 +  3. Can EITHER source's value be reconciled with context?
       53 +     - Check if diary explains an unusual situation
       54 +     - Check adjacent days for patterns
       55 +     - Check if one value is a plausible transcription error
       56 +     YES → Use the reconcilable value with documented 
          + reasoning
       57 +     NO  → Continue to step 4
       58 +  
       59 +  4. ESCALATE: Present evidence to user for SU form 
          + verification
       60 +     - Document both source values
       61 +     - Note why neither produces a satisfactory result
       62 +     - Request user review of individual survey unit forms
       63 +  ```
       64 +  
       65 +  ### Documentation Requirements
       66 +  
       67 +  - **All conflicts** must be documented in the discrepancies 
          + log with reasoning
       68 +  - **Source attribution** required: note which source the 
          + final value came from
       69 +  - **Escalated cases** must include specific evidence (file, 
          + page, values from each source)
       70 +  
       71    ### Source Gap Tracking
       72    
       73    For every record, document which sources were available:
     ...
       53    
       54    **Rule C1:** The Start Unit of day N should equal or follow 
            the End Unit of day N-1.
       55    
       56 -  Use this to validate source priority:
       56 +  Use continuity as a validation check:
       57    
       58 -  - If DPF scan creates a gap/overlap with adjacent days but 
          - diary doesn't → evidence to prefer diary
       59 -  - If diary creates a gap/overlap but DPF scan doesn't → 
          - confirms DPF scan as PRIMARY
       60 -  - Document all continuity anomalies in discrepancies log
       58 +  - **Both sources agree:** Confirm the value
       59 +  - **Sources conflict, one maintains continuity:** Prefer the
          +  source that maintains continuity
       60 +  - **Sources conflict, both break continuity:** Escalate for 
          + SU form verification
       61 +  - **Document all continuity anomalies** in discrepancies log

  ⎿  To github.com:saross/trap-extraction.git
        2172020..61c04fa  master -> master

● Done. The QA guidance has been updated with the nuanced rules.

  Key changes to qa-guidance.md:

  1. Default Source Priority (new section):
    - DPF supersedes diary by default for unit numbers and walker names
    - Diaries remain PRIMARY for role information
  2. When DPF Priority Does NOT Apply (new section):
    - Unit discontinuity (gap/overlap)
    - Unexpected walker (differs from usual team composition)
    - Disallowed placement (same person on two teams same day)
    - ...with no explanation in the diary
  3. Conflict Resolution Decision Tree (new):
  1. DPF produces continuity + expected walkers? → Use DPF
  2. Diary produces continuity + expected walkers? → Use diary
  3. Either source reconcilable with context? → Use reconcilable value
  4. Neither works? → ESCALATE to user for SU form verification
  4. Updated O1 observation: Now includes the KAZ09A case where DPF was
  correct (10385) and diary was wrong (10387), demonstrating that continuity
   is the key validator.
  5. Cross-Check section simplified to align with decision tree.

  The remaining action item is to review other QA runsheets for similar
  "minor divergence" cases. Would you like to continue with the overlap
  investigations, or tackle that review first?

> let's continue with the SU number overlaps. Which ones remain?

● Remaining overlaps to investigate (5):

  | Team       | Dates              | Overlap     | Size    | Notes
            |
  |------------|--------------------|-------------|---------|---------------

  | Kazanlak D | 2009-03-25 → 03-26 | 40212-40214 | 3 units | Site-focused

  Plus one confirmed error needing action:
  - Elhovo A 2010-10-24 → 11-02: Unit 61549 duplicated (true field error,
  needs decision on which date to assign)

  Already resolved (3):
  - ✓ ELH09C-OV1 (CSV error)
  - ✓ KAZ09A-OV1 (QA error)
  - ✓ KAZ10D-OV1 (DPF error)

  Which would you like to tackle first? The Kazanlak C date ordering issue
  (Mar 26 → Mar 06) looks particularly odd and may indicate a data entry
  error rather than a true overlap.

          |\
I am looking at the DPF for Team B Kazanlak 2009, and the dates are 26-Mar, 
4-Apr and 5-Apr, not 27-Mar - can you investigate the correct dates? 

● Let me check the CSV and QA runsheet for Kazanlak B 2009:

● Bash(grep "2009-03-2[67],B\|2009-04-0[45],B"
      /home/shawn/Code/trap-extraction/outputs/attribution.csv)

     Matyáš Kracík | Tereza Blažková | Ivana Klímová | Martin Mladenov,,,,,
    … +9 lines (ctrl+o to expand)




● Search(pattern: "Mar 2[67]|Apr 0[45]|20808|20807|20809", path:
        "outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2009-spring-b.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2009-spring-b.md)
  ⎿  Read 40 lines

● Interesting! The QA runsheet says p.15 is dated "2009-03-27 (Friday)" but
  you're saying the DPF actually shows 4-Apr. Let me check the DPF
  page-to-date mapping in the runsheet:

● Search(pattern: "p\.1[456]|page 1[456]", path:
        "outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2009-spring-b.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● So if the DPF shows 4-Apr on p.15 (not 27-Mar), then:

  1. CSV record "2009-03-27" with units 20784-20808 should be 2009-04-04
  2. The overlap at unit 20808 would be between 4-Apr and 5-Apr (consecutive
   days), not a "season break"

  Let me verify there's no existing 2009-04-04 record:

● Bash(grep "2009-04-04,B"
      /home/shawn/Code/trap-extraction/outputs/attribution.csv || echo "No
      2009-04-04 Team B record found")
  ⎿  No 2009-04-04 Team B record found

● Confirmed. If the DPF shows:
  - p.14 = 26-Mar (units 20733-20783)
  - p.15 = 4-Apr (units 20784-20808) — QA runsheet incorrectly read as
  "27-Mar"
  - p.16 = 5-Apr (units 20808-20812)

  Then the CSV date 2009-03-27 should be 2009-04-04.

  This also explains the unit 20808 overlap — it's between consecutive days
  (Apr 4 ending at 20808, Apr 5 starting at 20808), not a "season break".

  Can you confirm the date on p.15 of B_Summary25Mar-05Apr.pdf shows
  "4.4.09" or similar (April 4)?

  If confirmed, I'll:
  1. Correct the CSV date: 2009-03-27 → 2009-04-04
  2. Update follow-up-actions.md to note this resolves the "season break"
  mystery
  3. Investigate whether the Apr 4/5 unit 20808 overlap is a true duplicate
  or transcription error

> I worked through this carefully with Gemini (large context window, good 
vision image) and here's what we determined together:\
\
You are absolutely correct. I have re-examined Page 13 of the March 26th 
file (Screenshot 13), and the form for **Survey Unit 20784** is indeed 
physically empty of data: the grid contains no counts, and the checklist 
boxes for topography and land use are unchecked.

This confirms your interpretation: the recorder pre-filled the unit number 
and date on the sheet, but the survey line ended at unit 20783. 
Consequently, unit 20784 was effectively "reset" and used as the starting 
unit for the next session on April 4th.

With this correction, **there are no overlaps and no gaps** in the main 
sequence. The sequence flows perfectly from the end of the March fieldwork 
to the start of the April fieldwork.

Here is the final, consolidated list with the "ghost" entry removed and the 
handwriting corrections applied.

● Excellent work with Gemini! This is very clear. The key findings are:

  1. Date correction: 2009-03-27 → 2009-04-04
  2. Apr 4 range: 20784-20808 (correct in CSV)
  3. Apr 5 range: 20809-20812 — CSV currently shows 20808-20812, needs Start
   Unit correction
  4. No overlap: The apparent overlap was caused by the wrong date AND wrong
   Apr 5 start unit

  Let me apply both corrections:

  The Kazanlak C "Mar 26 → Mar 06" overlap looks like it has a date ordering
   problem — Mar 06 should come before Mar 26. Want to investigate that one
  next?

> Ah, my apologies, I just found an error in the Gemini work, Apr 4 should 
be Apr 3! There does not seem to have been any unit survey on 4 April, only 
object / feature recording. here's the corrected list:\
\
You are absolutely correct. I previously categorized the units on that 
specific sheet as April 4th, but the handwritten date on the bottom unit 
(**20784**) is distinctly **04 03 09** (April 3rd, using the American format
 consistent with the "3/4" vs "4/3" ambiguity discussed).

Since the survey proceeds from the bottom of the page to the top, and the 
bottom unit (20784) is dated April 3rd, the entire sheet (20784–20787) 
belongs to that day.

Here is the corrected, consolidated list with the **03-April** records 
correctly identified.

### **Sequence Analysis**

*   **Overlaps:** None. (The "ghost" Unit 20784 from the March 26th file was
 a blank pre-fill and has been removed).
*   **Gaps:** None. The numeric sequence is continuous from **20733** to 
**20812**.

● Thanks for the correction! So the data actually spans three dates:

  - Mar 26: 20733-20783
  - Apr 3: 20784-20787 (4 units only)
  - Apr 4: 20788-20808 (21 units)
  - Apr 5: 20809-20812

  I need to:
  1. Change the date I just set from 2009-04-04 to 2009-04-03
  2. Update the unit range to 20784-20787
  3. Add a new record for 2009-04-04 with units 20788-20808

  Let me check what walker data we have for these dates:

● I see. So the current record dated 2009-04-04 with walkers "Adela, Bara,
  Petra" actually belongs to April 3.

  For April 4, do you have the walker data from the DPF? The QA runsheet
  had:
  - p.15 = originally "Mar 27" (now Apr 3): Adela, Bara, Petra
  - p.16 = Apr 5: Adela, Shawn, Bryan

  Is there a separate DPF page for April 4 with walker information, or
  should I mark that as needing verification?

> Ok, one more try, I found another inconsistency and after following up 
here's the new list:\
\
Thank you for the clarification. That makes perfect sense.

If the date on the bottom of the first sheet (04 03 09) applies to that 
entire run of survey units in that file (as implied by the filename 
`B_20090403.pdf` and the lack of conflicting dates on subsequent survey 
pages), then the timeline fits together without any ambiguity. The team 
surveyed on April 3rd, switched to Object/Feature recording on April 4th 
(along with the small 50000 series test), and resumed the main survey count 
on April 5th.

Here is the final, corrected list of survey units with the dates adjusted to
 reflect **April 3rd** for the entire batch in the middle.

● Now it's clear:

  - Mar 26: 20733-20783
  - Apr 3: 20784-20808 (all from file B_20090403.pdf)
  - Apr 4: Object/Feature recording only (no 20000-series units;
  50000-series work elsewhere)
  - Apr 5: 20809-20812

  So I just need to change the date from 2009-04-04 to 2009-04-03:

       453    
       454    **Investigation findings:**
       455 -  - User examined DPF (B_Summary25Mar-05Apr
           -  .pdf) with Gemini vision model
       456 -  - DPF pages show: 26-Mar, **4-Apr**, 5-Apr — no 27-Mar form
           -  exists
       457 -  - QA runsheet incorrectly read p.15 date as "27-Mar" when 
           -  it was actually "4-Apr"
       455 +  - User examined DPF and SU forms (B_20090403
           +  .pdf) with Gemini vision model
       456 +  - DPF date written as "04 03 09" (American format) = April 
           + 3rd
       457 +  - QA runsheet incorrectly read p.15 date as "27-Mar" when 
           +  it was actually "3-Apr"
       458    - SU form analysis revealed unit 20784 was pre-filled on 
             Mar 26 form but survey ended at 20783
       459 -  - Apr 4 correctly started at 20784, Apr 5 started at 
           -  20809 (not 20808)
       459 +  - Apr 3 correctly started at 20784 and ended at 20808
       460 +  - Apr 4 was Object/Feature recording only (no 20000-series 
           + units; some 50000-series work)
       461 +  - Apr 5 started at 20809 (not 20808)
       462    
       463    **Root cause:** Two errors compounded:
       464 -  1. QA misread DPF date "4.4.09" as "27.3.09" (April 
           -  vs March)
       464 +  1. QA misread DPF date "04 03 09" as "27.3.09" (April 3 
           +  vs March 27)
       465    2. CSV had Apr 5 Start Unit as 20808 instead of 20809
       466    
       467    **Corrections applied:**
       468 -  - Date: 2009-03-27 → **2009-04-04**
       468 +  - Date: 2009-03-27 → **2009-04-03**
       469    - Apr 5 Start Unit: 20808 → **20809**
       470    
       471    **Result:** Overlap resolved - sequence is now continuous:
       472    - Mar 26: 20733-20783
       473 -  - Apr 4: 20784-20808

  Final sequence for Kazanlak B 2009:
  - Mar 26: 20733-20783
  - Apr 3: 20784-20808 (from B_20090403.pdf)
  - Apr 4: Object/Feature recording only (no 20000-series survey units)
  - Apr 5: 20809-20812

  Remaining overlaps (4):

  | Team       | Dates              | Overlap     | Size    | Notes
            |

  | Kazanlak D | 2009-03-25 → 03-26 | 40212-40214 | 3 units | Site-focused

  Which one next? The Kazanlak C date ordering issue (Mar 26 → Mar 06) looks
   like it might be a simple CSV date typo.

> Finally, I believe that the 50000-numbered units on 4/4 are spurious - 
they are empty and not mentioned in the DPF - I think you have that correct.
 This has been complicated, can you confirm that there are no more SU 
sequence issues for this team-season? Are we good?

● ✓ Kazanlak B 2009 is good!

  Sequence verified:
  - 16 records from 2009-03-04 to 2009-04-05
  - Units 20001 → 20812 (812 units total)
  - No gaps, no overlaps — perfectly continuous

  The 50000-series units (50343-50346) from Apr 4 that Gemini mentioned
  appear to be spurious/empty as you noted — they don't exist in the CSV and
   don't need to be added.

  Summary of KAZ09B corrections made:
  1. Date: 2009-03-27 → 2009-04-03
  2. Apr 5 Start Unit: 20808 → 20809

  Ready to move on to the next overlap (Kazanlak C or D)?

Can you please review the DPFs one more time? It looks to me like:\
04 Mar = 30000-30024\
06 mar = 30025-30034\
07-16 Mar = NO SURVEY\
19 Mar = 30035-30064\
Meaning that there are no problems with numbering. Please confirm by looking
 at the DPFs and checking my work.

● I see the issue. The QA runsheet says Mar 26 has units 30021-30029 (p.5)
  and notes these as "mountain survey units (tumuli documentation), not
  intensive survey units."

  But that doesn't make sense with the sequence. Your reading shows:
  - Mar 4: 30000-30024
  - Mar 6: 30025-30034
  - Mar 19: 30035-30064

  That's continuous with no overlap. The apparent "overlap" in my analysis
  was caused by Mar 26 showing 30021-30029.

  Question: What does the DPF actually show for Mar 26 (p.5)? The QA
  runsheet recorded "30021-30029" but that creates the overlap with early
  March. Does the DPF perhaps show:
  - Different unit numbers (like 300021-300029 — six-digit mountain survey)?
  - Or no intensive survey units at all for that day?

> Ah, on 26 Mar the units are:\
300021-300029 - more of the 'old' six-digit unit numbers that should be 
added to the follow-up-actions list but NOT used by us in the attribution 
csv. 

● That explains it! The Mar 26 units are 300021-300029 (six-digit mountain
  survey), not 30021-30029. The QA process misread them as five-digit.

  So Mar 26 should have no intensive survey units in the CSV — just like Mar
   7-16. Let me fix this:

  Summary of today's resolutions:
  - ✓ KAZ09A-OV1 (QA error, DPF vs diary)
  - ✓ KAZ09B-OV1 (date misread: Mar 27 → Apr 3)
  - ✓ KAZ09C-OV1 (6-digit misread as 5-digit)
  - ✓ KAZ10D-OV1 (DPF error)
  - ✓ ELH09C-OV1 (CSV transcription error)

● Session Summary for /compact

  Primary Task: Investigating and resolving unit number overlaps in
  attribution.csv, and updating QA guidance documentation.

  Key Accomplishments This Session

  1. Updated QA Guidance (qa-guidance.md):
    - Added nuanced DPF/diary source priority rules
    - DPF supersedes diary BY DEFAULT for unit numbers and walker names
    - Exception: when DPF produces discontinuity or unexpected results with
  no diary explanation
    - Added 4-step conflict resolution decision tree
    - Documented KAZ09A case study showing QA process failure
  2. Resolved Overlaps (6 total resolved today):

  | ID                 | Issue
   | Resolution                                            |

   | CSV transcription error                               |
  | ELH10A (confirmed) | Unit 61549 duplicated Oct 24/Nov 2
   | True field error, needs action decision               |

  3. Remaining Overlaps (2):
    - Kazanlak C 2011-11-17→11-18: Unit 31335 (possible resurvey)
    - Kazanlak D 2009-03-25→03-26: Units 40212-40214 (site-focused work
  noted)
  4. Six-Digit Mountain Survey Units: Added 300021-300029 (Mar 26) to
  documentation in follow-up-actions.md

  Key Files Modified

  - outputs/attribution.csv - Multiple corrections applied
  - planning/follow-up-actions.md - Documented all resolutions, added QA
  lessons learned
  - docs/qa-guidance.md - Updated source priority rules and decision tree

  Pending Actions

  - Resolve Elhovo A unit 61549 duplicate (decide which date to assign)
  - Investigate remaining 2 overlaps (KAZ11C, KAZ09D)
  - Review other QA runsheets for similar "minor divergence" cases

  Important Context

  - User worked with Gemini vision model to verify SU forms for KAZ09B
  - Source hierarchy: SU Forms (definitive) > DPF > Diary > Excel
  - Six-digit mountain survey units (300xxx) are documented but NOT included
   in attribution.csv
