  Both DPF scans include unit 61549 in their ranges. This means the overlap exists in the original paper records, not from an
  extraction error.

  Let me check what the Excel file and diary say about these specific dates:

● Search(pattern: "**/qa-runsheet*elhovo*2010*")
  ⎿  Found 3 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "**/qa-runsheet*elh*10*")

● Search(pattern: "61549|Oct.?24|Nov.?02|overlap", path: "outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2010-autumn-a.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The QA runsheet already captured this. Here's the key evidence:

  Analysis: Elhovo A Unit 61549 Overlap

  Sources

  Oct 24 (ends at 61549):
  - DPF (Day_03.pdf): Units 61476-61549 ✓
  - Diary: "Last unit: 61349" (typo for 61549) ✓

  Nov 2 (starts at 61549):
  - DPF (Day_05.pdf): Units 61549-61586
  - Diary: "First unit: 61553" but lists 61549 in unit samples

  Key Finding

  The diary for Nov 2 says the first unit was 61553, but the DPF shows 61549. This is a 4-unit discrepancy.

  If the diary is correct:
  - Oct 24 ends at 61549
  - Nov 2 should start at ~61550
  - Units 61550-61552 are unaccounted for (gap, not overlap)

  If the DPF is correct:
  - Unit 61549 was surveyed on both Oct 24 AND Nov 2 (true overlap/resurvey)

  Recommendation

  To resolve this definitively, please check the individual SU form for unit 61549:

  | Season      | Team | Dates to check  | Unit  | Location                                                     |
  |-------------|------|-----------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Elhovo 2010 | A    | Oct 24 OR Nov 2 | 61549 | Elhovo 2010-12-12/2010/Project Records/Team A/Field Records/ |

  The form will show the actual survey date recorded in the field, which will tell us whether:
  1. Oct 24's end unit should be 61548 (DPF error)
  2. Nov 2's start unit should be 61550 (DPF error)
  3. Unit 61549 was legitimately resurveyed on both dates

> I confirm that - based on the individual survey unit forms, which are the ultimate source of truth - that this overlap is real,
 unit 61549 appears BOTH at the end of Oct 24 and the beginning of Nov 2, this is an actual error.\
\
Please specify this situation in an easy-to-read way in the follow-up-actions document.\
\
Then, when finished, please thoroughly investigate:  | Elhovo C   | 2009-11-12 → 11-13 | 80939       | 1 unit  |

● Now let me investigate the Elhovo C overlap (unit 80939):

● Bash(python3 << 'EOF'
      import csv…)
  ⎿  ================================================================================
     ELHOVO TEAM C RECORDS - November 2009
     ================================================================================
     … +48 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Interesting! I see that Nov 13 had a QA correction:
  - Original Start_Unit: 80839
  - Corrected to: 80939
  - Reason: "typo confirmed by sequential unit logic"

  Let me check the QA runsheet and source documents:

● Search(pattern: "80939|80938|Nov.?12|Nov.?13|D023", path: "outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2009-autumn-c.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I understand. The QA runsheet shows:

  Nov 12 (D022):
  - Diary says: 80910-80938
  - CSV says: 80910-80939 (1 unit higher)

  Nov 13 (D023):
  - Diary says: 80939-80969
  - CSV originally had: 80839-80969 (typo, corrected)

  If the diary is correct for Nov 12 (ending at 80938), then there's no overlap - it would be:
  - Nov 12: 80910-80938
  - Nov 13: 80939-80969 (continuous)

  But the CSV has Nov 12 ending at 80939, creating the overlap.

  Let me check what sources are available and look at this more closely:

● Search(pattern: "D022|End unit|80938|80939", path: "outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2009-autumn-c.md", output_mode: "content")

● Analysis: Elhovo C Unit 80939 Overlap

  Summary of Sources

  | Date   | Source | Start Unit | End Unit |
  |--------|--------|------------|----------|
  | Nov 12 | Diary  | 80910      | 80938    |
  | Nov 12 | CSV    | 80910      | 80939    |
  | Nov 13 | Diary  | 80939      | 80969    |
  | Nov 13 | CSV    | 80939      | 80969    |

  QA History

  - D022 (Nov 12): Flagged discrepancy (diary 80938 vs CSV 80939), but marked "VERIFY_NO_CHANGE" - accepted CSV value
  - D023 (Nov 13): Corrected typo 80839→80939

  Analysis

  If the diary is correct:
  - Nov 12: 80910-80938 (29 units)
  - Nov 13: 80939-80969 (31 units)
  - Result: CONTINUOUS sequence, NO OVERLAP

  If the CSV is correct for Nov 12:
  - Nov 12: 80910-80939 (30 units)
  - Nov 13: 80939-80969 (31 units)
  - Result: OVERLAP on unit 80939

  Most Likely Scenario

  The diary appears internally consistent:
  - Nov 12 ends at 80938
  - Nov 13 starts at 80939 (next sequential number)

  The CSV value of 80939 for Nov 12 is likely an Excel/transcription error where 80938 was entered as 80939.

  Verification Needed

  To confirm, please check the individual SU forms:

  | Season      | Team | Unit  | Question                                  |
  |-------------|------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
  | Elhovo 2009 | C    | 80938 | What date is recorded? (Should be Nov 12) |
  | Elhovo 2009 | C    | 80939 | What date is recorded? (Should be Nov 13) |

  Location: Elhovo 2010-12-12/2009/Project Records/Team C/FieldRecords/

  If 80938 shows Nov 12 and 80939 shows Nov 13, then:
  - The diary is correct
  - Nov 12 End_Unit should be corrected from 80939 to 80938
  - The overlap would be resolved

● Excellent! This is definitive. The SU forms confirm:

  | Date   | Start Unit | End Unit | Count    |
  |--------|------------|----------|----------|
  | Nov 12 | 80910      | 80938    | 29 units |
  | Nov 13 | 80939      | 80969    | 31 units |
  | Nov 14 | 80970      | 81008    | 39 units |

  Key findings:
  1. Nov 12 should end at 80938, not 80939 - CSV is wrong, diary was correct
  2. No overlap - sequence is continuous
  3. Nov 14 ends at 81008, not 81002 as in CSV (6 more units)
  4. Anomaly: Unit 80916 is dated Nov 11 (in middle of Nov 12 sequence) - likely a form dating error

  - Overlap was a CSV transcription error (80938 entered as 80939)
  - Diary was correct all along
  - SU forms provided definitive proof
  - Also discovered Nov 14 had 6 more units than recorded (81008 not 81002)
  - Overlap resolved - sequence is now continuous

  Would you like me to continue investigating the remaining overlaps? The next candidates are:

  | Priority | Team       | Overlap                       | Size      | Notes              |
  |----------|------------|-------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|
  | 1        | Kazanlak D | 2010-03-20/21: 40424-40432    | 9 units   | Largest overlap    |
  | 2        | Kazanlak A | 2009-03-19/20: 10386-10387    | 2 units   |                    |
  | 3        | Kazanlak C | Multiple date ordering issues | 4-5 units |                    |
  | 4        | Kazanlak D | 2009-03-25/26: 40212-40214    | 3 units   | Noted as site work |
  | 5        | Kazanlak B | 2009-03-27/04-05: 20808       | 1 unit    | Season break       |

> yes, I will continue. let's take on Kaz D 2010, you investigate while I transcribe the SU forms 

● I'll investigate Kazanlak D 2010-03-20/21 (the 9-unit overlap) thoroughly.

  - Mar 21: 40424 - 40482
  - Overlap: Units 40424-40432 (9 units)

  Notably, Mar 21 has no PDF_Source - it came only from XLS. Let me check the sources:

  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The QA runsheet shows this overlap was confirmed in both CSV and DPF:
  - Mar 20: 40354-40432 (DPF confirmed ✓)
  - Mar 21: 40424-40482 (DPF confirmed ✓, "note: overlaps Mar 20")

  So this is in the original source documents, not a transcription error. Let me check the diary:

  The Overlap

  | Date    | Start Unit | End Unit | Total                              |
  |---------|------------|----------|------------------------------------|
  | Mar 20  | 40354      | 40432    | 78 units                           |
  | Mar 21  | 40424      | 40482    | 56 units (but starts 9 units back) |
  | Overlap | 40424      | 40432    | 9 units                            |

  Source Agreement

  The QA runsheet (completed Dec 1) noted:
  - Both CSV and DPF agree on this overlap
  - The DPF (D_2010Summary.pdf) shows:
    - Mar 20: 40354-40432 ✓
    - Mar 21: 40424-40482 ✓
  - The overlap was marked as "not an error - both sources agree"

  Possible Explanations

  1. Field recording error - wrong start unit written on Mar 21 DPF (should be 40433)
  2. True resurvey - units 40424-40432 were surveyed on both days
  3. Sub-team split - different walkers covered these units on different days

  Unit Count Analysis

  If Mar 21 should have started at 40433 (no overlap):
  - Mar 20: 40354-40432 = 79 units ✓
  - Mar 21: 40433-40482 = 50 units
  - Mar 22 starts at 40483 = continuous ✓

  What the SU Forms Will Tell Us

  Please check units 40424-40432 (the overlapping units):

  | Unit  | Question                       |
  |-------|--------------------------------|
  | 40424 | What date? (Mar 20 or Mar 21?) |
  | 40425 | What date?                     |
  | 40426 | What date?                     |
  | 40427 | What date?                     |
  | 40428 | What date?                     |
  | 40429 | What date?                     |
  | 40430 | What date?                     |
  | 40431 | What date?                     |
  | 40432 | What date?                     |

  Also useful: Units 40433-40435 to confirm Mar 21 continuity.

  Location: Kazanluk/2010/Project Records/Team D/ (SU forms folder)

> I am having Gemini transcribe but just looking at the forms, it appears to me that last SU number on the 20th is 40423, and 
40424 is the first SU on the 21st. yes, Gemini's transcription agrees, I won't bother pasting the whole list here. 

● Excellent! So the DPF for Mar 20 has an error:

  | Date   | DPF shows   | SU Forms show | Error               |
  |--------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
  | Mar 20 | 40354-40432 | 40354-40423   | End unit wrong (+9) |
  | Mar 21 | 40424-40482 | 40424-40482   | Correct ✓           |

  Result: No overlap - sequence is continuous. Mar 20 ends at 40423, Mar 21 starts at 40424.

  Summary: The largest overlap (9 units) was a DPF recording error. The field crew wrote 40432 instead of 40423 on the Mar 20
  form. SU forms are definitive - sequence is now continuous.

The DPFs clearly show 10370-10385 on 19 March and 10386-10444 on 20 March. Please look at A_2009Summary.pdf and confirm (a) I'm 
looking at the right form, and (b) I'm not making an error reading the numbers 

● Let me check our records and compare with what you're seeing:

● Bash(python3 << 'EOF'
      import csv…)

● I see the discrepancy! The CSV shows:
  - Mar 19: 10370 - 10387
  - Mar 20: 10386 - 10444

  But you're seeing in the DPF:
  - Mar 19: 10370 - 10385
  - Mar 20: 10386 - 10444

  If the DPF shows Mar 19 ending at 10385, then the CSV is wrong (+2 error), and there's no overlap - it's continuous.

  Let me check the QA runsheet to see what was recorded:

● Search(pattern: "Mar.?19|Mar.?20|10385|10386|10387", path: "outputs/qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2009-spring-a.md", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● The QA runsheet reveals the source of the problem:

  QA Runsheet Finding (from qa-runsheet-kazanlak-2009-spring-a.md)

  Mar 19:
  - DPF: 10370-10385, Total: 16 units
  - Diary: 10370-10387
  - CSV followed diary (hence the overlap)

  Mar 20:
  - DPF: 10386-10444

  Analysis

  You're reading the DPF correctly:
  - (a) Right form: Yes, A_2009Summary.pdf
  - (b) Numbers correct: Yes, DPF shows 10385 for Mar 19 end unit

  The DPF is internally consistent:
  - Mar 19: 10370-10385 = 16 units (matches "Total: 16" on form)
  - Mar 20: 10386-10444 = 59 units (continuous)

  The diary has the error (10387 instead of 10385), and the CSV incorrectly followed the diary.

  Correction Needed

  - Mar 19 End Unit: 10387 → 10385

  This resolves the overlap. Want me to apply this correction?

> Yes, I don't know what went wrong, the guidelines should state that the DPF supercedes the diary 

● You're right - the source hierarchy should have DPF as authoritative for unit numbers over diary. Let me correct this:
