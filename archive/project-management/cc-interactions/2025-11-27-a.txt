> /compact   Session Summary: ELH 2009 Autumn Team A QA (26 Nov 2025)

  Completed Work

  QA corrections applied to attribution.csv:
  - D015: No correction needed — SU form (60192.pdf p.56) confirmed CSV unit 
60195 is correct; diary had transcription error (60196)
  - D016: Corrected walker substitution for Oct 26-29: Eric/Erik Andersen → 
Tereza/Tereza Dobrovodská (4 records, 8 field updates)
  - D017: No correction needed — Team A records didn't have erroneous "No autumn
 survey season" text (exists on Team C Oct
  14,16,17,18 — deferred)
  - D018: Added Diary_Author (Adela Sobotkova) to Nov 9 record

  Key finding — Tereza disambiguation:
  Two Terezas present in 2009 autumn (Blažková and Dobrovodská). Resolved via 
team roster cross-reference: T. Dobrovodská was on Team
   C Oct 12-22, sick Oct 23, then available to substitute for Eric on Team A Oct
 26-29. T. Blažková had no Team C presence — may have
   had specialist role (ceramics/bioarchaeology). Methodology documented in 
discrepancies log D016.

  Documentation Updated

  - outputs/attribution.csv — 9 field corrections with QA notes
  - outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2009-autumn-a.md — complete with applied 
corrections
  - docs/qa-discrepancies-log.md — D015-D018 with full disambiguation 
methodology
  - outputs/source-inventory.md — Team A diary coverage, SU form reliability 
note, file-to-date index expanded
  - planning/follow-up-actions.md — Added T. Blažková 2009-autumn observation

  Outstanding (Deferred)

  - 5 records still have erroneous "No autumn survey season" notes (4 Team C 
2009, 1 Team B 2010) — to be addressed when those teams
  are QA'd

  Project State

  - ELH 2009 Autumn: Teams A & B QA complete; Team C pending

● Let me check the SU forms to verify the unit numbers for the records with

      C/FieldRecords/80115.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (289.6KB)

● Excellent! The SU forms provide valuable verification. Let me analyse what
   I see:

  From 80103.pdf:
  - Page 1: "Day 1" - Unit 80000 dated Oct (first survey day = Oct 12)
  - Page 21: "Day 3" - Unit 80063 dated 15 (Oct 15) - Date: 15
  - The forms continue beyond 80103...

  From 80115.pdf:
  - Shows "EXTENSIVE SURVEY" forms dated "A5-" (Oct 15)
  - Units 80104, 80106, 80107, 80108 visible
  - This confirms Oct 15 continued beyond unit 80103 to at least 80108+

  Key finding: The diary table has Oct 15 end unit as 80103, but the SU
  forms and CSV show survey continued to 80115. The CSV is correct; diary
  has a transcription error.

  Now let me compile my findings and create the runsheet:

  Do you approve:
  1. D019: Removing erroneous "No autumn survey season" text from Oct 14,
  16, 17, 18?
  2. D021: Removing Georgi from Oct 22 walker lists?
  3. D023: Correcting Nov 13 Start_Unit from 80839 to 80939?

> These look like straightforward requests, but can you please generate a 
runsheet? I'd like to make sure we've happy with the format of the runsheet 
and the process of using it. 

● I've already created the runsheet. Let me show it to you:

● Read(outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2009-autumn-c.md)
  ⎿  Read 284 lines

● There's the full runsheet. The structure includes:

  1. Header — Team, date range, sources consulted
  2. Team Composition — Phase-by-phase roster changes
  3. Record-by-Record Verification — Each date with diary quote, CSV
  comparison, status
  4. Issues Summary — Table of all discrepancies found
  5. Corrections Required — Detailed before/after for each fix
  6. Summary Statistics — Counts and categories
  7. User Decisions Required — Checkboxes for approval
  8. Notes — Observations and reasoning

  ---
  Questions about the format:

  1. Is the level of detail appropriate, or would you prefer more/less?
  2. Should the record-by-record section be more concise (just issues) or is
   documenting confirmed records useful?
  3. Are the "User Decisions Required" checkboxes helpful, or would you
  prefer a different approval mechanism?
  4. Any other sections you'd like added or removed?

  Once you're happy with the format, I can apply the corrections. Or if
  you'd like changes to the runsheet template, I can update it before we
  continue.

> ah, I see it! 

● Great! So are you happy with the format? If so, shall I proceed with
  applying the three corrections?

  1. D019: Remove erroneous "No autumn survey season" text from Oct 14, 16,
  17, 18
  2. D021: Remove Georgi from Oct 22 walker lists
  3. D023: Correct Nov 13 Start_Unit from 80839 to 80939

  Just say the word and I'll apply them to attribution.csv.

> I *really* like the daily breakdown / summary - **definitely keep this and
 make sure it's in the template**. Under 'Correct QA_Notes' are survey units
 really missing? You seem to have them. *If* there are days when no survey 
took place, make sure that the QA_Notes reflect that - we shouldn't *expect*
 survey units or roles, these non-survey days are fine / complete, there 
should just be a note to the effect of 'no survey information; non-survey 
day' or similar. I agree with all of these changes otherwise, but *please* 
remember to put in an 'Approve / Modify' section for me to provide feedback 
directly in the runsheet - that's the second time you've forgotten, I'm not 
sure why that particular detail. It will be important if/when we hit 
team-seasons where there are more errors or more complicated errors. 

● You're absolutely right on both points:

  1. Non-survey days: Oct 14, 16, 17, 18 had NO survey — the team didn't
  walk. So "MISSING: Survey units" is wrong. There's nothing missing; it's
  complete as a non-survey day. I'll change the QA_Notes to something like
  "Non-survey day (no field walking conducted)"
  2. Approve/Modify section: I apologise — I did include one at the bottom
  (lines 251-263), but I think you want it inline with each correction so
  you can mark directly on the document. I'll fix that.

  Let me update the runsheet:

● Update(outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2009-autumn-c.md)
  ⎿  Updated outputs/qa-runsheet-elhovo-2009-autumn-c.md with 13 additions

       185    ```
       186    
       187 -  **Reasoning:** The "No autumn survey season" note was 
           - incorrectly applied during initial extraction. The diary 
           - clearly documents these as legitimate non-survey days 
           - (fatigue, rain, trip to Burgas).
       187 +  **Reasoning:** These are legitimate non-survey days 
           + documented in the diary:
       188 +  - Oct 14: "We didn't walk in the fields because the 
           + Bulgarians from museum were tired"
       189 +  - Oct 16: "Today we didn't walk because it was raining"
       190 +  - Oct 17: "It was also raining today so we didn't walk 
           + again"
       191 +  - Oct 18: "A trip to Burgas"
       192    
       193 +  Nothing is "missing" — these records are complete as 
           + non-survey days.

       271    ### Diary Observations
       272 +  
       273    1. **Oct 15 unit count:** Diary table shows 54 total units 
             with end unit 80103, but 80062-80103 is only 42 units. The 
             actual end unit 80115 gives 54 units (80062-80115), matching
              the total. Transcription error in diary.
       274    
       275    2. **Oct 22 "Tereza" anomaly:** Record still lists Tereza 
             in walkers, but diary says only 5 people walked. However, 
             Tereza didn't leave until Oct 26. Need to verify if Oct 22 
             should have Tereza (diary unclear on her presence that 
             specific day vs Georgi's absence).

● Done! I've updated the runsheet with:

  1. Better QA_Notes for non-survey days: Now reads Non-survey day (no field
   walking conducted) — nothing is "missing"
  2. Inline Approve/Modify sections: Each correction (D019, D021, D023) now
  has its own decision box right with the evidence

  Here's the updated corrections section structure:

  ### D019: Correct QA_Notes for non-survey days (4 records)
