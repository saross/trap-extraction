     Plan: Rigorous Manual QA for Kazanluk 2010 Spring Team C

     Goal: Conduct a thorough, methodology-compliant manual QA review of KAZ-2010-C (20 records) following the established TRAP 
     QA methodology.

     Previous Attempt Issues:
     - Source conflicts accepted without investigation (just declared "DPF PRIMARY")
     - Missing detective work (team patterns, diary narratives, cross-team checks)
     - Missing approval form with user decision checkboxes
     - No investigation of Peter/Dasha identity error root cause

     ---
     Phase 1: Source Inventory & Setup

     1.1 Locate All Sources

     | Source          | File                                  | Purpose                             |
     |-----------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
     | DPF Summary     | C_2010Summary.pdf (FieldRecords/)     | PRIMARY for units AND walkers       |
     | Individual DPFs | C_20100317.pdf through C_20100413.pdf | Detailed verification for conflicts |
     | BG Diary        | C_2010Diary_BG.doc                    | Walker names, context, narratives   |
     | EN Diary        | C_2010Diary_En.docx                   | Secondary cross-reference           |
     | Excel           | Kaz10_SurveySummary.xls               | Unit ranges                         |
     | CSV             | original-attribution.csv              | Current extraction to verify        |

     1.2 Extract Team Roster

     From BG Diary header, identify:
     - Regular Team C members (stable roster)
     - Visitors/temporary participants (like Asen)
     - Team leader

     ---
     Phase 2: Detective Work for Known Conflicts

     2.1 Peter vs Dasha Investigation (D006, D007)

     Issue: Mar 31 and Apr 1 have "Peter" in CSV, but DPF and BG diary show "Dasha"

     Investigation steps:
     1. Check where Peter (Petar Minkov) was on Mar 31 and Apr 1
       - Was he on a different team?
       - Check Team A, B, D records for these dates
     2. Check Team C composition pattern
       - Who was regularly on Team C?
       - Is Dasha a regular?
     3. Read BG diary narrative for Mar 31 and Apr 1
       - Any mention of personnel changes?
     4. Check individual DPF scans (C_20100331.pdf, C_20100401.pdf)
       - Verify walker names legibility

     Expected outcome: Determine if this is extraction error or data mixing between teams

     2.2 Mar 28 Source Conflict (D004)

     Issue: DPF shows Todor, BG diary shows Asen

     Investigation steps:
     1. Check Mar 27 - both DPF and BG diary agree on Asen
     2. Read BG diary narrative for Mar 28
       - Any mention of who came/left?
     3. Check individual DPF scan (C_20100328.pdf)
       - Verify legibility of 5th walker name
     4. Apply H1 (Team stability)
       - If Asen was there Mar 27, likely still there Mar 28
     5. Check if Todor was on another team Mar 28

     Expected outcome: Determine whether DPF has transcription error or BG diary has error

     2.3 Apr 9 Source Conflict (D008)

     Issue: DPF shows Jiri, BG diary shows Dasha

     Investigation steps:
     1. Check who Jiri (Jiří Musil) is
       - Was he ever on Team C?
       - What team was he normally on?
     2. Read BG diary narrative for Apr 9
       - Any mention of visitors or personnel changes?
     3. Check individual DPF scan (C_20100409.pdf)
       - Verify legibility of 5th walker name
     4. Check Dasha's pattern
       - Was Dasha on Team C other days?
       - If Dasha was on Mar 31 and Apr 1, was she still around Apr 9?

     Expected outcome: Determine which source is correct with reasoning

     2.4 Mar 26 Walker Count (D002)

     Issue: CSV has 4 walkers, BG diary shows 5 (with Viki and Todor)

     Investigation steps:
     1. Check individual DPF scan (C_20100326.pdf)
       - Count walker columns/names
     2. Verify BG diary entry for Mar 26
     3. Check if Mar 26 DPF Summary entry is complete

     ---
     Phase 3: Cross-Team Verification

     3.1 Locate Peter on Mar 31 / Apr 1

     Scope: Check ALL Kazanluk 2010 teams (per user request)

     Check other team records for these dates:
     - Team A records (if exists for 2010)
     - Team B records (if exists for 2010)
     - Team D records (if exists for 2010)
     - Any other teams operating in Kazanluk 2010

     Search CSV for "Peter" or "Petar Minkov" entries on Mar 31 and Apr 1 across all teams.

     Determine: Was Peter somewhere else, or is he incorrectly listed on Team C?

     3.2 Team C Composition Pattern Analysis

     Create table of walkers across all 19 survey days:
     - Identify core/regular members
     - Identify visitors (single-day appearances)
     - Flag anomalies (people appearing unexpectedly)

     ---
     Phase 4: BG Diary Narrative Reading

     Read full narrative entries (not just "Екип:" lines) for:

     1. Mar 27-28: Context for Asen's presence
     2. Mar 31 / Apr 1: Any mention of Dasha or personnel changes
     3. Apr 9: Any mention of Jiri or visitors
     4. Any entries mentioning Peter

     Look for:
     - Personnel change mentions ("X joined us", "Y was away")
     - Weather/conditions affecting team composition
     - Visitor mentions

     ---
     Phase 5: Individual DPF Scan Verification

     For each conflicting day, read the individual DPF PDF (not just Summary):

     | Date   | File           | Verify                      |
     |--------|----------------|-----------------------------|
     | Mar 26 | C_20100326.pdf | Walker count and names      |
     | Mar 28 | C_20100328.pdf | 5th walker (Todor vs Asen)  |
     | Mar 31 | C_20100331.pdf | 4th walker (Peter vs Dasha) |
     | Apr 1  | C_20100401.pdf | 4th walker (Peter vs Dasha) |
     | Apr 9  | C_20100409.pdf | 5th walker (Jiri vs Dasha)  |

     ---
     Phase 6: Update Runsheet with Findings

     6.1 Document Each Investigation

     For each source conflict, document:
     - Evidence from each source
     - Detective work performed
     - Reasoning for resolution
     - Confidence level

     6.2 Add Approval Form

     Each correction must include:

     **User Decision:**
     - [ ] Approve
     - [ ] Modify: _______________

     **Status:** Pending

     6.3 Complete Record-by-Record Section

     Ensure every record has explicit verification with:
     - DPF values
     - BG diary values
     - CSV values
     - Status and notes

     ---
     Phase 7: Missing Record Investigation (D010)

     Issue: Apr 13 appears in DPF Summary but not in CSV

     Investigation steps:
     1. Verify Apr 13 exists in DPF Summary (Day 19)
     2. Check BG diary for Apr 13 entry
     3. Check EN diary for Apr 13 mention
     4. Verify this isn't a date transcription error
     5. Confirm record should be added

● CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Peter (Pesho/Petar Minkov) was on Team B on Mar 31!

  2010-03-31,B - Adela | Martin | Pesho | Stana | Petra Tušlová
  2010-03-31,C - Bara | Sonja | Elena | Peter | Todor (← IMPOSSIBLE)

  This violates H2 (One team per day) — Peter cannot be on both Team B and Team C on the same day. The Team C entry must be
  wrong.

  Also noted: Jiří Musil (Jiri) is listed in the BG diary header as a Team C participant!

  Let me continue reading the BG diary narrative for the conflicting dates:

  |--------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | Mar 27 | Елена, Бара, Соня, Яна, Асен   | Confirms Asen (not Todor in CSV)  |
  | Mar 28 | Елена, Бара, Соня, Яна, Асен   | Confirms Asen (not Todor in DPF)  |
  | Apr 1  | Елена, Бара, Соня, Тодор, Даша | Confirms Dasha (not Peter in CSV) |
  | Apr 9  | Елена, Бара, Соня, Тодор, Иржи | Confirms Jiri (not Dasha!)        |

  Cross-Team Evidence for Apr 1:
  - Team B: Adela | Petra Tušlová | Martin — NO Peter
  - Team C CSV: Peter — WRONG (should be Dasha per BG diary)
  - Team D: NO Peter

  Let me check Mar 31 BG diary entry more carefully:

● Read(Kazanluk/2010/Project Records/Team C/FieldRecords/C_20100331.pdf)
  ⎿  Read PDF (322.7KB)

● The individual DPF scan for Mar 31 (C_20100331.pdf) shows:
  - Day 13 header
  - 5 walker positions used (columns 1-5)
  - Unit forms show "31 March" or "31 Mar"

  The walker positions in the bottom-left corners show 5 walkers were present. Combined with the DPF Summary showing "Bara,
  Sonja, Elena, Todor, Dasa", this confirms Dasha (not Peter) was on Team C.

  Let me search for Mar 31 in BG diary and check individual DPF for Apr 9:

● CRITICAL BG DIARY FIND for Mar 31:

  31. ІІІ. 2010 – сряда
  Времето е слънчево и безоблачно.
  Екип: Елена. Бара, Соня, Даша, Тодор.

  BG Diary CONFIRMS Dasha (Даша) on Mar 31, NOT Peter!

  And looking at the Apr 9 DPF scan (Day 18) with the BG diary:
  9. IV. 2010 – Петък
  Екип: Елена, Бара, Соня, Тодор, Иржи

  Both BG diary AND DPF agree: Jiri (Иржи) on Apr 9 - there's NO source conflict here! I was wrong earlier.
