> Hi CC, VS Code crashed again. Unfortunately this is a known video 
rendering bug. Luckily I exported our conversation before the crash. Please 
look at archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-23-d.txt, and resume 'Phase 1' work.
 

● I'll read the conversation archive to understand what Phase 1 work we were
   doing.

● Read(archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-23-d.txt)
  ⎿  Read 180 lines

● I can see from the conversation that we completed the comprehensive
  supersession review and identified that Phase 1 is to update the
  attribution CSV for Team B using the already-extracted PRIMARY source
  data.

  Let me set up the todo list and continue with Phase 1:

● Read(outputs/team-b-diary-new-extraction.csv)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines

● Read(outputs/team-b-supersession-report.md)
  ⎿  Read 253 lines

● Now let me look at the current Team B records in the attribution CSV to
  understand what needs updating:

● Search(pattern: "^2010-11-(02|03|04|05|06|11|12|14|15),B,", path:
        "outputs/attribution.csv", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Error searching files

● Bash(pwd)

    D-2020-04


● Search(pattern: "^2010-11-(02|03|04|05|06|11|12|14|15),B,", path:
        "claude_extraction/outputs/attribution.csv", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 9 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! I can see that Phase 1 has already been completed before the
  crash. The attribution.csv already shows:

  - All 8 records updated with PRIMARY source data (Team B Diary new.docx)
  - The missing 2010-11-06 record has been added
  - The 2010-11-11 record correctly retained Day_08.pdf (no diary entry for
  that date)
  - All extraction notes indicate "Updated from PRIMARY source"

  Let me verify the data matches correctly by checking a few key fields:

● Read(outputs/attribution.csv)
  ⎿  Read 1 line

● Excellent news! Phase 1 has already been completed before the crash. All
  Team B records have been successfully updated in the attribution CSV. Let
  me verify the data is correct:

● Bash(cd claude_extraction && python3 << 'EOF'
      import csv…)
  ⎿  === VERIFICATION OF TEAM B PHASE 1 UPDATES ===

     Checking 9 Team B records:
     … +57 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Phase 1 is complete and verified. Here's what was accomplished
  before the crash:

  Phase 1 Summary - Team B Updates ✅

  All 9 Team B records successfully updated:
  - ✅ 8 records updated to PRIMARY source (Team B Diary new.docx)
  - ✅ 1 new record added (2010-11-06) that was missing
  - ✅ 1 record correctly retained PDF source (2010-11-11 - no diary entry)

  Key improvements achieved:
  - Leader names corrected (Dr. Ross instead of OCR errors)
  - GPS operator roles added (were missing from PDFs)
  - Paper recorder roles added
  - Consistent walker name formatting
  - Post-season data quality corrections (March 2011 version)

  Files location:
  - Updated data: claude_extraction/outputs/attribution.csv:193-203
  - Extraction script: claude_extraction/scripts/extract_team_b_diary_new.py
  - Supporting docs: team-b-supersession-report.md,
  superseded-sources-comprehensive-review.md

  Next Steps - Phase 2?

  According to the comprehensive review, Phase 2 would be:
  - Extract Team A Diary (A_Diary.docx) - PRIMARY source
  - Update 5+ Team A records currently using Tier 3 PDFs
  - Benefits: More accurate walker names, role data, fewer OCR errors

  Would you like me to proceed with Phase 2 (Team A extraction), or would
  you prefer to review the Phase 1 changes first?

  ⎿  Conversation exported to: archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-23-e.txt

> Yes, please proceed with Phase 2. 

● I'll proceed with Phase 2 - extracting Team A Diary and updating those
  records. Let me set up the work plan:

     **Date:** 23 November 2025
     **Issue:** Elhovo 2010 Team A records extracted from Tier 3 PDF sources
      need updating to PRIMARY diary source
     ## Background
     The source inventory indicates that "A_Diary.docx" (26 KB, March 2011) 
     is the PRIMARY source for Elhovo/Yambol 2010 Team A, containing 
     post-season data quality corrections. However, the current attribution 
     CSV contains data extracted from PDF files (Day_XX.pdf) which are Tier
     3 sources (scanned forms) and less reliable than the Tier 2 diary
     source.

● Perfect! I've organised the archive and moved all completed work. Here's
  what was accomplished:

  Archive Organisation Summary

  Archive Structure

  Each archive subdirectory now has a comprehensive README.md explaining:
  - Project scope and completion status
  - Files contained and their purpose
  - Key outcomes achieved
  - Related files still in active use

  Files Retained in outputs/

  Active working files:
  - attribution.csv - Current attribution data
  - manual-extraction-guide.md - Extraction methodology reference
  - source-inventory.md - Source catalogue
  - submission-readme.md - Current submission documentation
  - attribution.csv.backup* - Timestamped backups (6 files)

  Archive Layout

  archive/
  ├── README.md (comprehensive archive guide)
  ├── cc-interactions/ (15 conversation exports)
  ├── supersession-project/ (6 files + README)

  ├── intermediate-data/ (8 CSV files)
  ├── outputs/ (3 superseded CSV files)
  └── reports/
      └── phase1-extraction/ (5 files)

  The archive is now well-organised with clear documentation of what each
  section contains and why files were archived. All completed project phases
   have been moved while keeping active working files accessible in
  outputs/.

> your archive layout diagram is very useful, should we have a manifest.md 
for the archive that includes it and a list of files, or perhaps add that 
information to the archive/ README.md? 

● Excellent idea! I think adding it to the existing archive/README.md makes
  the most sense - it keeps everything in one place and avoids having
  multiple documents to maintain. Let me enhance the README with a
  comprehensive file manifest.

       86    ## Archive Organisation Principles
       87    
       88    Files are archived when they represent:

● Perfect! I've enhanced the archive/README.md with a comprehensive file
  manifest that includes:

  What was added:

  1. Complete Archive Manifest section with:
    - Full tree structure diagram with inline comments
    - Description of every file's purpose
    - Visual indicators (✅) for completed projects
    - File counts (e.g., "6 files" for conversation exports)
    - Total count: 49 files across 10 directories
  2. Enhanced organisation showing:
    - Completion status for each major project
    - Date information for time-stamped work
    - Clear categorisation of file types
    - Relationships between files (e.g., Team A/B reports linked to
  extractions)

  The manifest now provides:
  - Quick overview - See what's in each directory at a glance
  - File descriptions - Understand what each file contains
  - Navigation aid - Find specific documents quickly
  - Historical record - Track when work was completed

  This makes the archive self-documenting and easy to navigate for anyone
  reviewing the project work later. The tree structure shows both the
  hierarchy and the purpose of each file, which should be really helpful for
   understanding the project organisation.

> Great work, thanks. I have finished reviewing 
'manual-extraction-guide.md'. I added my suggested actions to the document 
itself, in sections that look like this: \
\
**Suggested resolution:** You are correct, this diary has only a single list
 of walkers at the beginning of the diary. Teams were often, but not always,
 stable. Course of action: *default* to this list of walkers for every day 
of the season for this team *unless* individual diary entries *or* another 
source (such as the scans of the daily progress sheets) indicate different 
walkers, in which case prioritise the specific list from the daily diary 
entry or the other source.
\
I have responded to *all* issues. Can you please review the MD document and 
confirm that you can see, and that you understand, my suggested resolutions?

  Confirmed Suggested Resolutions

  Issue 1: Date Discrepancy (2010-03-08, Team C)

  Status: Not yet addressed in your review - awaiting your investigation

  Issue 2: Failed Extractions (12 Records)

  1. 2009-10-23, Team C (Line 118)
  ✓ Understood: Default to overall walker list for all dates unless specific
   daily entries or other sources indicate different walkers. Specific
  information supersedes defaults.

  2. 2009-11-14, Team A (Line 138)
  ✓ Understood: Use NLP to read narrative entries for walker lists and role
  information (e.g., "usual setup"). Identify defaults from narrative, use
  those unless specific daily info or other sources contradict them.

  3. 2010-04-06, Team B (Line 161)
  ✓ Understood: No action needed - rainy day, no fieldwalking occurred. Not
  a missing extraction.

  4-5. 2010-04-07 & 2010-04-08, Team A (Line 181)
  ✓ Understood: Use English diary (A_2010Diary_En.docx) for these dates.
  Promote EN diary to co-PRIMARY status in source-inventory with coverage
  note (BG ends 28 March, EN has April entries).

  6. 2010-04-07, Team C (Line 200)
  ✓ Understood: Entry exists with non-standard date format (7. IV. 2010).
  Re-extract with awareness of multiple date formats (day.month.year with
  Roman numerals for months). Check all Bulgarian diaries for non-standard
  formats; may need NLP or script updates.

  7. 2010-11-14, Team B (Line 223)
  ✓ Understood: Use pandoc (now installed) for .docx files. Use "Team B
  Diary new.docx" (PRIMARY). May already be extracted in supersession
  project work.

  8. 2011-10-24, Team A (Line 242-246)
  ✓ Understood: Entry exists (rainy day, no survey but site visits). Extract
   from the Bulgarian text you provided about the 5-person group visiting
  sites.

  9. 2011-11-08, Team B (Line 263)
  ✓ Understood: Entry exists under "Date: 08 November, Tuesday". Re-attempt
  extraction - no obvious obstacles.

  10. 2011-11-10, Team D (Line 278)
  ✓ Understood: No diary entry available (last entry was 2 November). Rely
  on other sources.

  11. 2011-11-29, Team B (Line 293)
  ✓ Understood: No diary entry available (last entry was 28 November). Rely
  on other sources.

  Key Themes I've Extracted

  1. Default walker lists: Use overall team lists as defaults unless
  contradicted
  2. Narrative extraction: Use NLP for diaries with embedded walker info
  3. Date format variations: Need to handle Roman numerals and other formats
   in Bulgarian diaries
  4. Source hierarchy: Specific daily info > defaults; other sources can
  supersede
  5. Non-survey days: Some "failures" are actually non-working days
  6. Missing coverage: Some dates genuinely have no diary entries
  7. Source promotion: EN diary for Kaz 2010 Team A should become co-PRIMARY

  All resolutions are clear and actionable. Should I proceed with
  implementing these extractions?

   what happened:

  Resolution (from archive/project-summaries/follow-up-actions.md):

  Issue #1 - Already ✅ COMPLETED

  The Problem: Excel date error (2010-03-08 should have been 2010-04-08)

  What you determined:
  - The Excel SurveySummary had the wrong date: 2010-03-08
  - Correct date was: 2010-04-08
  - The diary entry dated "18.03.2010" was for 18 March (a separate, correct
   entry)
  - 08 March couldn't exist because the survey season started 17 March

  Actions you completed:
  - ✅ Created corrected Excel: Kaz10_SurveySummary-NEW-2025-correction.xlsx
  - ✅ Deleted incorrect 2010-03-08 Team C entry from attribution.csv
  - ✅ Transferred survey units (30742-30773) to correct 2010-04-08 entry
  - ✅ Verified 2010-03-18 entry was already correct with walker data
  - ✅ Created backup: attribution.csv.backup_date_correction

  Result: Total records: 269 → 268 (removed duplicate)

  Should I update the manual-extraction-guide.md to replace Issue #1 with
  this completed resolution information?

        8 +  ## Issue 1: Date Discrepancy - ✅ RESOLVED
        9    
       10    ### The Problem
       11    
       12    **Record:** 2010-03-08, Team C, Leader: Bara
       13 -  **Issue:** The Excel SurveySummary lists
          -   this as 8 March 2010, but the diary entry is
          -   dated **18 March 2010** (18.03.2010)
       13 +  **Issue:** The Excel SurveySummary listed
          +   this as 8 March 2010, but the diary entry was
          +   dated **18 March 2010** (18.03.2010)
       14    
       15 -  ### File Location
       15 +  ### Resolution (Completed 23 November 2025)
       16    
       17 -  **File:** `C_2010Diary_BG.doc`
       18 -  **Full path:** `/media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3

          - Records/Team C/C_2010Diary_BG.doc`
       19 -  **Version:** PRIMARY (214 KB) - Most complete Bulgarian 
          - diary
       17 +  **Determination:** The Excel file contained an error. The 
          + correct date was **2010-04-08** (8 April), not 2010-03-08 (8 
          + March).
       18    
       19 -  ### Walker Data Found
       19 +  **Investigation findings:**
       20 +  - The diary entry dated "18.03.2010" was for **18 March** - 
          + a separate, correct entry
       21 +  - **08 March** could not exist because the survey season 
          + started 17 March
       22 +  - Row 45 in Excel SurveySummary incorrectly showed 
          + 2010-03-08 but should have been 2010-04-08
       23 +  - Row 30 with 2010-03-18 was already correct and matched 
          + diary/PDF sources
       24 +  - 08 April diary entry was missing, but PDF exists 
          + (`C_20100408.pdf`)
       25    
       26 -  The diary entry for **18 March 2010** contains walker data 
          - that was **NOT** extracted due to the date mismatch.
       26 +  **Actions completed:**
       27 +  - ✅ Created corrected Excel file: 
          + `Kaz10_SurveySummary-NEW-2025-correction.xlsx`
       28 +  - ✅ Deleted incorrect 2010-03-08 Team C entry from 
          + attribution.csv
       29 +  - ✅ Transferred survey units (30742-30773) to correct 
          + 2010-04-08 entry
       30 +  - ✅ Verified 2010-03-18 entry already correct with walker 
          + data from diary
       31 +  - ✅ Created backup: 
          + `attribution.csv.backup_date_correction`
       32    
       33 -  ### Decision Required
       33 +  **Result:**
       34 +  - Total records: 269 → 268 (1 duplicate removed)
       35 +  - 2010-04-08 Team C now has complete data (units + walkers 
          + from PDF)
       36 +  - 2010-03-18 Team C confirmed correct with walker data from 
          + diary
       37    
       38 -  You need to determine which date is correct:
       38 +  **Note:** The corrected Excel file should be cascaded to all
          +  copies of TRAP 2010 data outside the regular backup 
          + pipeline.
       39    
       40 -  **Option A: Excel is wrong, diary is correct (18 March)**
       41 -  - Action: Change date in attribution.csv from 2010-03-08 to 
          - 2010-03-18
       42 -  - Re-run extraction script to capture walker data
       43 -  - Check if 2010-03-18 already exists as a separate record
       44 -  
       45 -  **Option B: Diary is wrong, Excel is correct (8 March)**
       46 -  - Action: Manually extract walker data from the 18 March 
          - diary entry
       47 -  - Apply to the 2010-03-08 record
       48 -  - Note discrepancy in Extraction_Notes
       49 -  
       50 -  **Option C: Both are correct (two different survey days)**
       51 -  - Possibility: Typo in diary header, content actually from 8
          -  March
       52 -  - Action: Review diary content context to determine actual 
          - date
       53 -  - Check if 2010-03-18 exists as a separate record in Excel
       54 -  
       55 -  ### How to Investigate
       56 -  
       57 -  1. **Check Excel SurveySummary:**
       58 -     ```
       59 -     File: Kazanluk/2010/Project Records/Master 
          - Records/Kaz10_SurveySummary.xls
       60 -     Look for: Does 2010-03-18 Team C exist as a separate 
          - entry?
       61 -     ```
       62 -  
       63 -  2. **Read diary entry:**
       64 -     ```bash
       65 -     antiword "/media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d84
          - 68/synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-2020-04/Kazanluk/2010/Project 
          - Records/Team C/C_2010Diary_BG.doc" | grep -A 30 "18.03.2010"
       66 -     ```
       67 -  
       68 -  3. **Check survey unit numbers:**
       69 -     - Compare unit numbers in diary entry vs Excel record
       70 -     - Matching units = same survey day (date typo somewhere)
       71 -     - Different units = different survey days
       72 -  
       73 -  ### Recommended Workflow
       74 -  
       75 -  ```
       76 -  1. Open Kaz10_SurveySummary.xls
       77 -  2. Search for Team C entries between 2010-03-08 and 
          - 2010-03-18
       78 -  3. Note the unit ranges for each entry
       79 -  4. Read the 18 March diary entry
       80 -  5. Match unit numbers to determine correct date
       81 -  6. Make decision and document in attribution.csv 
          - Extraction_Notes
       82 -  ```
       83 -  
       84 -  ### After Decision
       85 -  
       86 -  If you determine the correct date and walker data, update 
          - `attribution.csv` manually:
       87 -  - Locate the row: Date=2010-03-08, Team=C
       88 -  - Update Walkers_Original and Walkers_Transliterated columns
       89 -  - Add note to Extraction_Notes: "Date verified as [correct 
          - date]; walker data from diary entry dated 18.03.2010"
       90 -

● Excellent! I've updated the manual-extraction-guide.md with:

  1. ✅ Issue #1 - RESOLVED with your complete investigation and resolution
  details
  2. ✅ Updated checklist showing:
    - Issue #1: Completed (23 Nov 2025)
    - 4 items marked N/A or already completed (#3, #7, #10, #11)
    - 7 remaining extraction tasks with your suggested resolutions

  Confirmed Status

  All issues now have resolutions:

  Already Completed (5 items):

  1. ✅ Issue #1 - Date discrepancy (23 Nov 2025)
  2. ✅ #3 - 2010-04-06 Team B (no fieldwalking, rainy day)
  3. ✅ #7 - 2010-11-14 Team B (extracted in supersession project)
  4. ✅ #10 - 2011-11-10 Team D (no diary entry exists)
  5. ✅ #11 - 2011-11-29 Team B (no diary entry exists)

  Ready to Extract (7 items with your guidance):

  1. #1 - 2009-10-23, Team C → Use default walker list
  2. #2 - 2009-11-14, Team A → Extract with NLP from narrative
  3. #4-5 - 2010-04-07/08, Team A → Extract from EN diary, promote to
  co-PRIMARY
  4. #6 - 2010-04-07, Team C → Re-extract with date format awareness
  5. #8 - 2011-10-24, Team A → Extract from Bulgarian text you provided
  6. #9 - 2011-11-08, Team B → Re-attempt extraction

  I have clear, actionable instructions for all 7 remaining extractions.
  Would you like me to proceed with implementing these now?

> huh, did you already implement the resolutions to the other issues? I 
thought you still needed to do them all (except for some perhaps superseded 
by the work you've already done updating to 'new' primary diaries)? 

● You're absolutely right - I have NOT yet implemented the resolutions for
  the remaining failed extractions. I only:

  1. ✅ Completed the supersession project (Team A and Team B from Yambol
  2010)
  2. ✅ Updated the manual-extraction-guide.md with your suggested
  resolutions
  3. ❌ Did NOT actually extract the 7 remaining records yet

  Let me verify what the supersession project actually covered:

● Read(archive/supersession-project/team-b-diary-new-extraction.csv)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines

● You're correct! I got ahead of myself. Here's the actual status:

  What I've ACTUALLY Completed:

  - ✅ Supersession project: Team B dates 2010-11-02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 12,
  14, 15
  - ✅ Supersession project: Team A dates 2010-10-22, 23, 24, 2010-11-02, 03

  So #7 (2010-11-14 Team B) was genuinely extracted in the supersession
  project.

  What Still Needs Extraction (7 items):

  1. #1: 2009-10-23, Team C - Use default walker list from diary top
  2. #2: 2009-11-14, Team A - Extract from narrative with NLP
  3. #4-5: 2010-04-07/08, Team A - Extract from EN diary, promote to
  co-PRIMARY
  4. #6: 2010-04-07, Team C - Re-extract handling multiple date formats
  5. #8: 2011-10-24, Team A - Extract from Bulgarian text you provided
  6. #9: 2011-11-08, Team B - Re-attempt extraction

  Items genuinely N/A:
  - #3: 2010-04-06 Team B (rainy day, no survey)
  - #10: 2011-11-10 Team D (no diary entry)
  - #11: 2011-11-29 Team B (no diary entry)

  I have your suggested resolutions documented but haven't implemented them
  yet. Would you like me to proceed with the 7 remaining extractions now?

> Let's /compact and start it with fresh context. Can you (a) tell me 
whether I've done an /export since our last compact (it would be called 
2025-11-23-e.txt if I did) and (b) compose a /compact message so we can 
resume smoothly in the next session.
