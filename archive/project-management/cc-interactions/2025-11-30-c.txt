> /compact Session Summary: TRAP QA Corrections - Kazanluk 2010 Team C

  Completed Tasks

  1. Built comprehensive corrections manifest 
(outputs/qa-corrections-manifest-comprehensive.json)
    - Documents all 29 corrections across 5 QA runsheets

    - All 5 runsheets now status: APPLIED
  2. Applied Kazanluk 2010 Team C corrections to attribution.csv (7 record 
updates + 1 new record):
    - D002: Mar 26 - Added Viki + Todor
    - D003: Mar 27 - Todor→Asen, [unclear]→Jana
    - D004: Mar 28 - Added Asen (5th walker)
    - D005: Mar 30 - [unclear]→Todor
    - D006: Mar 31 - Peter→Dagmar Winklerová
    - D007: Apr 1 - Peter→Dagmar Winklerová
    - D008: Apr 9 - [unclear]→Jiří Musil
    - D010: Apr 13 - NEW RECORD added (units 30801-30809)
  3. Updated runsheet status (qa-runsheet-kazanluk-2010-spring-c-manual.md) to 
COMPLETE

  Final State

  - attribution.csv: 271 records (was 270)
  - All QA runsheets: APPLIED (Elhovo 2009 A/B/C, Elhovo 2010, Kazanluk 2010 C)

  Pending

  - Git commit/push: External Synology drive too slow - user needs to run 
manually:
  cd trap-extraction && rm -f .git/index.lock && git add -A && git commit && git
 push

  - outputs/attribution.csv
  - outputs/qa-corrections-manifest-comprehensive.json (NEW)

> ok, I've been planning to move my working directory to the local drive 
here, but the data is all on the external drive, if our working directory is
 in my local /home/Code directory, can I still give you access to the 
external drive? 

● Yes, absolutely. Claude Code can access files anywhere on your filesystem
  that you have permissions for, not just within the working directory.

  How it works:

  1. Working directory (/home/Code/...) - Where we run commands, create
  scripts, manage git repos
  2. External drive (/media/shawn/191c3b96.../) - Just use absolute paths to
   read/write files there

  What changes:
  - Relative paths (like outputs/attribution.csv) would resolve from the new
   working directory
  - For external drive files, use absolute paths: /media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5
  -4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-2020-04/...

  Benefits of local working directory:
  - Much faster git operations (no more lock file timeouts)
  - Faster file reads/writes for scripts and temp files
  - External drive only accessed when you explicitly need that data

  Typical setup pattern:
  /home/shawn/Code/trap-extraction/     # Local: scripts, configs, git repo
  ├── scripts/
  ├── docs/
  └── outputs/                          # Could symlink to external if
  needed

  /media/shawn/.../TRAP-WD-2020-04/     # External: raw data, archives
  ├── data/
  └── sources/

  Would you like me to help set up a local working directory structure? I
  could also create symlinks to frequently-accessed external directories if
  that would be useful.

> I'll go ahead and move it manually then re-open CC in the new directory - 
can you compose a message I can paste in the new session to help you pick up
 where we are leaving off? I believe that our next task is to run the 
automated pipeline over the rest of the folders, if I understand where we 
are correctly, we successfully tested the automated script here? 

● Here's a handoff message for your new session:

  ---
  TRAP QA Corrections Project - Session Handoff

  Working Directory: Previously /media/shawn/.../trap-extraction/ (external
  Synology NAS), now moved to local drive for faster git operations.

  External Data Location: /media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/
  synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-2020-04/

  Completed This Session:
  1. Built comprehensive corrections manifest:
  outputs/qa-corrections-manifest-comprehensive.json (29 corrections across
  5 QA runsheets)
  2. Applied Kazanluk 2010 Team C corrections to outputs/attribution.csv (7
  updates + 1 new record)
  3. Updated runsheet status to COMPLETE:
  outputs/qa-automation-test/qa-runsheet-kazanluk-2010-spring-c-manual.md

  QA Runsheets Status (all APPLIED):
  - Elhovo 2009 Teams A, B, C
  - Elhovo 2010
  - Kazanluk 2010 Team C (manual)

  Pending:
  - Git commit/push of all changes (deferred due to slow external drive)

  Next Steps - Clarification Needed:
  The 5 completed runsheets were manual QA reviews. Please review
  outputs/qa-automation-test/ to confirm what automated pipeline exists and
  its current state. Key questions:
  - Is there a script that generates QA runsheets automatically?
  - What folders/seasons still need QA review?
  - What does "running the automated pipeline over the rest of the folders"
  mean specifically?

  Key Files:
  - outputs/qa-corrections-manifest-comprehensive.json - All documented
  corrections
  - outputs/attribution.csv - Main data file (271 records)
  - archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-30-a.txt - Previous session log

  ---
  To be honest, I'm not certain about the "automated pipeline" you're
  referring to. The work I see in the context was manual QA review and
  correction application. Could you clarify what automated script you're
  thinking of, or point me to its location? That will help me give you a
  more accurate handoff.

> Sorry, can you check qa-automation-plan.md and see where we are?

  External Data: /media/shawn/191c3b96.../synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-2020-04/

  Current State:
  - QA automation infrastructure COMPLETE (docs/qa-automation/)
  - 5 of 18 teams QA'd (Elhovo 2009 A/B/C, Elhovo 2010 B, Kazanlak 2010 C)
  - 13 teams remaining in qa-queue.yaml

  Next Task: Run qa-prompt-template.md on remaining teams
  - Start with ELH-2010-A (next in queue)
  - Update qa-queue.yaml to mark KAZ-2010-C complete

  Key Files:
  - docs/qa-automation/qa-prompt-template.md - The automated prompt
  - docs/qa-automation/qa-queue.yaml - Team queue (needs KAZ-2010-C update)
  - planning/qa-automation-plan.md - Full plan reference
  - outputs/qa-corrections-manifest-comprehensive.json - Applied corrections

  Pending Git: Run manually due to slow external drive:
  cd trap-extraction && rm -f .git/index.lock && git add -A && git commit &&
   git push

  Would you like me to update qa-queue.yaml to mark KAZ-2010-C as complete
  before you move directories?
