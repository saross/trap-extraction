● Kazanlak 2010 Extraction Complete

  I've extracted walker data from all 8 Kaz 2010 diary files (BG and EN versions for Teams A-D) and updated the attribution CSV.

  Summary

  28 records updated with accurate walker names from diaries, replacing OCR errors from PDF scans (e.g., "Resto" → "Pesho", "Lindsiv" →
  "Lindsay", "Toshe" → "Martin")

  Coverage improved:
  - Walker coverage: 78.1% → 82.9% (+4.8 percentage points)
  - Added 13 new walker records to previously empty fields

  Key team compositions extracted:

  | Team | Leader          | Core Members                                                   |
  |------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
  | A    | Julia Tzvetkova | Pesho, Tereza, Lindsay, Petra T., Yulia Dimitrova              |
  | B    | Adela           | Lubomir, Vera, Petra, Pesho, Nadya, Martin, Renee, Stana, Dasa |
  | C    | Elena/Bara      | Bistra, Sonja, Jana, Todor, Lindsay                            |
  | D    | Zhoro           | Julia T., Nadja, Ljubo, Vera, Bogdana                          |

  Files updated:
  - final_attribution_v2_cleaned_edited.csv - 28 records corrected
  - work-summary.md, README.md, submission-readme.md - stats updated

  Script created: scripts/update_kaz2010_walkers.py for reproducibility

> Can I ask, when you are looking at the diaries, are you capturing the other roles in the attribution spreadsheet, e.g., 'PDA 
operator', etc., or have you just been extracting walkers? 

● Good question - I've only been extracting walker names, not the other roles. However, the diaries do contain role information that I
  could capture. For example, from Team B's EN diary:

  - "PDA: Petra, Nadya, Pesho. GPS: Tereza. Forms: Vera."
  - "PDA: Tereza, Pesho. GPS: Petra T."
  - "GPS: Adela, Dasa. PDA: Adela. Pics: Renee."

  The Team A EN diary also has entries like:
  - "PDA: Tereza, Pesho" / "GPS: Petra T"

  Would you like me to go back through the Kaz 2010 diaries and extract the PDA_Operator, Paper_Recorder (Forms), and other role data?
  It would improve coverage of those currently sparse fields.

> let's do that on another pass - to make it easier, can I suggest making a master list of all sources, in order of priority:\
\
- Tier 1\
Excell 'SurveySummary' files\
\
- Tier 2\
Diaries\
\
- Tier 3\
Scanned 'daily progress' forms\
\
Did I miss any? Can you populate each of these tiers with all sources you have used? You can use relative paths from:\
\
/media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-WD-2020-04/\
