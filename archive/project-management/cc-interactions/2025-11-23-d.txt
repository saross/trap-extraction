     # Comprehensive Superseded Sources Review
     **Date:** 23 November 2025
     **Purpose:** Identify all cases where SECONDARY sources were extracted
     when PRIMARY sources exist
     ---
     ## Summary
     After comprehensive review of the source inventory and attribution CSV,
      I identified **2 supersession cases** where data extraction used
     SECONDARY or lower-tier sources when PRIMARY sources exist:

     … +213 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● I've completed the comprehensive review of all sources for supersession
  issues. Here's what I found:

  Superseded Sources Summary

  2 supersession cases identified requiring action:

  1. Yambol 2010 Team B (HIGH PRIORITY - Ready to Update)

  - Status: Extraction complete, ready to update CSV
  - Issue: Used SECONDARY sources (Team B Diary.docx + Day_XX.pdf files)
  instead of PRIMARY
  - PRIMARY source: Team B Diary new.docx (March 2011 corrected version)
  - Impact: 8 records need updating, 1 missing record (2010-11-06) to add
  - Benefits: More complete roles, corrected names, post-season data quality
   fixes

  2. Yambol 2010 Team A (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Needs Extraction)

  - Status: PRIMARY diary not yet extracted
  - Issue: Used Tier 3 PDFs (Day_XX.pdf) instead of Tier 2 PRIMARY diary
  - PRIMARY source: A_Diary.docx (diary source more reliable than scanned
  forms)
  - Impact: 5+ records affected (2010-10-22, 23, 24, 2010-11-02, 03,
  possibly more)
  - Benefits: More accurate walker names, role data, fewer OCR errors

  All Other Sources: No Issues

  I reviewed all PRIMARY/SECONDARY designations in the source inventory:
  - Kazanlak 2009-2011: PRIMARY sources correctly prioritised (BG diaries
  used appropriately)
  - PDF sources: Finalized (PRIMARY) versions correctly used, not Scans
  (SECONDARY)
  - Elhovo 2009: PRIMARY diaries correctly used for Teams A, B, C
  - Language variants: Both BG and EN extracted for reference where
  appropriate (not supersession)

  Files Created

  1. superseded-sources-comprehensive-review.md - Full analysis with action
  plan
  2. team-b-supersession-report.md - Detailed Team B comparison (already
  created)
  3. team-b-diary-new-extraction.csv - Extracted PRIMARY data for Team B
  (already created)

  Recommended Next Steps

  Phase 1 (HIGH): Update attribution CSV for Team B using the extracted data
  Phase 2 (MEDIUM): Extract A_Diary.docx and update Team A records

  Ready to proceed with Team B updates when you approve, or I can extract
  Team A diary first if you prefer to review both before updating the CSV.

> before we proceed, I'd like to /export our conversation, but I need to 
change the working directory, can you tell me how to do that? 

● To change the working directory in Claude Code, you can use the cd command
   via bash:

  cd /media/shawn/191c3b96-5fa5-4d0d-8805-0cf05d3d8468/synology/Adela/TRAP-W
  D-2020-04/claude_extraction

  Or, from your current location in the outputs/ directory, you can go up
  one level:

  cd ..

  Then the export path would be:
  /export archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-23-d.txt

  Alternatively, you can stay in your current directory and use the correct
  relative path for the export:
  /export ../archive/cc-interactions/2025-11-23-d.txt

  Which approach would you prefer? I can run the cd command for you if you'd
   like me to change the working directory.

> cd .. 

● Bash(cd ..)

● Done! The working directory is now:
