# Team B Diary Supersession Report

**Date:** 23 November 2025
**Issue:** Elhovo 2010 Team B records extracted from SECONDARY source need updating to PRIMARY source

## Background

The source inventory indicates that "Team B Diary new.docx" (26 KB, March 2011) is the PRIMARY source for Elhovo/Yambol 2010 Team B, containing post-season data quality corrections. However, the current attribution CSV contains data extracted from PDF files (Day_XX.pdf) which are less reliable than the diary source.

## Sources

- **PRIMARY (should use):** `Team B Diary new.docx` - Post-season corrected version from March 2011
- **SECONDARY (currently used):** Various Day_XX.pdf files - Scanned daily progress forms with OCR errors
- **Also exists:** `Team B Diary.docx` (25 KB, December 2010) - Original field version, less complete

## Summary

- **8 records need updating** to use PRIMARY diary source instead of PDFs
- **1 record is missing** (2010-11-06) and should be added
- **1 record (2010-11-11)** has no diary entry, so keep existing PDF data

## Key Improvements from PRIMARY Source

1. **More complete role data:** GPS and Forms/Paper Recorder roles are specified in diary but missing from PDFs
2. **Correct leader names:** PDFs show "Shawn Ross Ross" (OCR error?), diary shows "Dr. Ross"
3. **Consistent walker names:** Diary uses standard initials/names throughout
4. **Post-season corrections:** March 2011 version includes data quality fixes
5. **Author attribution:** Diary explicitly states who wrote each entry

## Recommended Action

1. Update all 8 affected records in attribution.csv with data from PRIMARY diary
2. Add missing 2010-11-06 record
3. Update PDF_Source column to reference "Team B Diary new.docx" instead of Day_XX.pdf
4. Add note in Extraction_Notes indicating data updated from PRIMARY source

## Name/Initial Expansion Guide

- RL = Royce Lawrence
- JP = Julia Prazniak
- ACQ = Ashley Chee Quee

- EL = Elaine (needs full name)
- PT = Petra Tušlová
