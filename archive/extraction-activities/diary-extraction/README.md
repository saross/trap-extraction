# Diary Extraction Planning Archive

**Completion Date:** 21 November 2025
**Project Completion:** 23 November 2025 (100% walker coverage achieved)

This archive contains planning and search documentation for diary-based data extraction across the TRAP project.

**Part of:** TRAP Attribution Extraction Project v1.0.0 (see `../../PROJECT-COMPLETION.md`)

## Project Summary

- **Purpose:** Systematic planning for extracting walker and role data from field diaries
- **Scope:** Identified available diary sources across all seasons (2009-2011)
- **Status:** COMPLETED - Planning phase; actual extraction work documented elsewhere

## Files

- `diary-extraction-plan.md` - Comprehensive extraction strategy and methodology
- `diary-extraction-report.md` - Report on diary availability and extraction priorities
- `diary-search-results.md` - Search results cataloguing available diary sources

## Key Outcomes

- **Complete inventory** of 15+ diary sources across all teams and seasons (2009-2011)
- **Source hierarchy established:**
  - Tier 1: Excel SurveySummary (SUPPLEMENTAL - baseline only)
  - Tier 2: Field diaries (PRIMARY - preferred sources)
  - Tier 3: Survey unit PDFs (SECONDARY - cross-verification)
  - Tier 4: Individual survey unit PDFs (39 files identified)
- **Extraction methodology developed** for handling diary format variations
- **Foundation for supersession project** - Enabled identification of 14 records needing PRIMARY source updates
- **Result:** 258/268 records (96.3%) now use PRIMARY diary sources

## Related Work

- **Supersession Project:** Used this planning work to identify PRIMARY sources
  - See: `archive/supersession-project/`
- **Source Inventory:** Complete source catalogue maintained in `outputs/source-inventory.md`

## Notes

These planning documents were instrumental in:
1. Identifying the Team A and Team B supersession cases
2. Establishing source hierarchy and prioritisation rules
3. Guiding systematic extraction approach
