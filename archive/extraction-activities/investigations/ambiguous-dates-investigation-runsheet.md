"Team composition: Elena Bozhinova, Petar Minkov, Meglena Parvin, Charlotte Baron.

Survey area: Northern gentle slope of Bichkiynitsa, descending toward Tundzha River
(near the reservoir). The ridge crest is extensive and flat, branching and ending in
two weakly expressed elevations, visiting which is the goal of the survey...

On the highest northern part [of the eastern elevation], a burial mound necropolis was
registered - DS 052 (Vid 008) consisting of 3 mounds, located relatively close to each
other. The southeastern is the largest and is designated as Mound 1. The entire ridge
is occupied by dense mixed forest and observation possibilities are limited. Located
3.4 km at 122º from the village of D. Sahrane.

Mound 1 has a conical shape with a flat crest. The mound peak is marked with a
triangulation sign. The mound is disturbed by many large looters' pits, which prevent
determination of the shape and dimensions. Dimensions: d-50m (measured E-W), h from
E - about 6-7m, from W - 5-5.5m... [Extremely detailed descriptions of 4 major looters'
excavations with measurements, soil stratigraphy, depths up to 5.5m, wooden ladders,
rock layers, dark soil layers, possible grave structures]

Mound 2 has an oval base and truncated cone shape. Located 42m at 252º from Mound 1.
Dimensions: d (E-W) - 22m, d (N-S) - 27m, h (max) from N - 4m. GPS coordinates:
N-42º37.059'; E-025º15.881'; 462m elevation...

Mound 3 is located 52m at 334º from Mound 1 and 60m at 17º from Mound 2. Has the form
of a sphere segment with circular base. Dimensions: d - 17m, h (N-max) - 2m, h (S) - 1m..."

**INTERPRETATION:**
This entry documents intensive archaeological recording of a burial mound necropolis with
3 mounds. The team spent the entire day conducting detailed measurements, GPS recording,
soil analysis, and structural documentation of each mound and looters' excavations.

NO SURVEY UNITS MENTIONED - this was intensive site documentation work, not unit-based
systematic survey.

```

**PDF form findings:**

- Survey Units field contains: N/A
- Form completeness: X Complete  □ Partially filled  □ Mostly blank
- Activity type indicated: 'No intensive, no extensive, no mountain [survey]' - only object registration (from Daily Progress Form scan)

[Full entry 57 lines - ridge survey and mound documentation]

Key content:
- Surveyed eastern part of ridge, east of Malkata Koriyska spring
- Covered strips 40m-200m wide along ridge areas
- Mound Vid 009: d-12m, h~1m, low flat mound with old shallow looter's pit
  GPS: N-42º36.250', E-025º16.507', 493m elevation
- Mound ГЧ 051 (Vid 010): d-10m, h-1.2-1.4m, disturbed by shallow looters' pits
  Possible stone krepida (ring of rocks visible in periphery)
  GPS: N-42º36.257'; E-025º16.539'; 493m elevation
- Adjacent worked stone block (0.55 x 0.9 x 0.9m, two worked sides)
- Terrain covered: ridge areas with grass and tree vegetation, limited visibility
- Terraced areas for modern cultivation (former acacia forest)

**English translation (key findings):**

"Team composition: Elena Bozhinova, Petar Minkov, Meglena Parvin, Charlotte Baron.

Survey area: Eastern part of the ridge, east of the Malkata Koriyska spring to the
promontory formed between the reservoir and the Kalnishka river arm. Goal for the day
is to cover the ridge areas.

Survey began along dirt roads immediately east of the highest part of the ridge -
location 'Bichkiynitsa'. Surveyed a strip 40m wide around the dirt road leading from
'Bichkiynitsa' to the M. Koriyska spring. Terrain covered with grass vegetation, limited
observation possibilities along the dirt road and in small patches of disturbed soil.
Terrain is gravelly and sterile. No archaeological materials found...

Survey continued east along the ridge crest, which has elevations marked on the map
with good exposure. On the southwestern part of the southern elevation, where the ridge
ends and the southern slope begins, a burial mound was registered - GCh 051 (Vid 010).
Mound located 4.9 km at 318º from the village of G. Cherkovishte. Surrounding terrain
has medium observation possibilities, occupied by sparse grass and tree vegetation...

The mound has a circular base, probably originally had the form of a sphere segment,
disturbed in the central part by shallow looters' pits. Dimensions: d-10m, h (max from
E) - 1.2-1.4m. From the west its periphery merges with the surrounding terrain. In the
mound periphery, following its circular base, in several places the upper parts of rock
fragments are exposed on the surface, which probably describe its entire periphery and
are part of a stone krepida. One of the largest visible rock fragments is in the
northeast sector and has dimensions 70 x 60 x 60 cm. Graphic sketch made of the
situation (scale 1:50).

At a distance of 50m at 75º from the mound, on the ridge crest of the peak, there is an
exposure of bedrock, next to which a rock fragment is set, with two worked sides (N and E).
Its long side is oriented N-S (10º). Its dimensions are: 0.55 x 0.9 x 0.9 (height) m.
GPS coordinates: N-42º36.257'; E-025º16.539'; 493m elevation."

**INTERPRETATION:**
This entry documents ridge survey work covering multiple terrain types (40m-200m wide
strips) and intensive documentation of two burial mounds (Vid 009 and GCh 051/Vid 010).
The team conducted systematic reconnaissance along the ridge crest, identifying mounds,
taking GPS coordinates, making sketch plans, and documenting structural features like
stone krepida.

NO SURVEY UNITS MENTIONED - this was ridge reconnaissance and intensive mound
documentation work, not unit-based systematic survey.

```

**PDF form findings:**

- Survey Units field contains: 300003 - 300007, 300009
- Form completeness: X Complete  □ Partially filled  □ Mostly blank
- Activity type indicated: 'Mountain' survey and object recording

**Other source findings:**

```
Undertook mountain survey using six-digit SU numbers.



```

### Conclusion

**Survey units found:**

- Start Unit: 300003  End Unit: 300009 (BUT 300008 skipped)

**OR, if no units:**

- Reason: □ No survey undertaken
         □ Non-unit survey work (specify): _________________________
         □ Form incomplete/unclear
         □ Other: _________________________

**Confidence level:** X High  □ Medium  □ Low

## Date 3: 2009-04-05 Team B (Sunday)

### Problem Description

- **Status:** PDF Daily Progress Form exists but survey unit numbers are unclear/illegible
- **What we know:**
  - PDF forms B_Summary25Mar-05Apr.pdf and B_2009Summary.pdf both show a form for this date
  - Unit number field appears incorrectly filled or illegible (possibly "20280" to "20838" or "1:30"?)
  - Individual unit cards exist (B_20090405.pdf) but no consolidated Daily Progress Form
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Question:** Can we decipher the unit numbers, or was this a non-standard day?

### Files to Check

**Primary sources (relative to TRAP-WD-2020-04/):**

1. **Team B PDF Summaries:**
   - Path 1: `Kazanluk/2009/Project Records/TeamB/Finalized/B_Summary25Mar-05Apr.pdf`
     - Page: 1 (top right form)
     - Look for: Daily Progress Form dated 5 April 2009
     - Try to decipher: Start Unit and End Unit fields

   - Path 2: `Kazanluk/2009/Project Records/TeamB/Finalized/B_2009Summary.pdf`
     - Search for: 5 April 2009 or "05.04" form
     - Cross-reference with B_Summary25Mar-05Apr.pdf

2. **Individual unit cards:**
   - Path: `Kazanluk/2009/Project Records/TeamB/Finalized/B_20090405.pdf`
   - Look for: Individual survey unit numbers on cards (first and last card)
   - Note: These are individual intensive survey unit cards, not Daily Progress Forms

3. **Team B English Diary:**
   - Path: `Kazanluk/2009/Project Records/TeamB/B_Diary_En.docx`
   - Look for: April 5, 2009 or "05.04.2009" or "5 April" entry
   - Extract: Survey unit numbers or description of activity

4. **Team B Bulgarian Diary:**
   - Path: `Kazanluk/2009/Project Records/TeamB/B_Diary_BG.doc`
   - Look for: "05.04.2009 г." entry

### Investigation Findings

**Date examined:** 2025-11-24

**PDF form (B_Summary25Mar-05Apr.pdf page 1) findings:**

- Start Unit field reads: 20808
- End Unit field reads: 20812
- Legibility: X Clear  □ Somewhat unclear  □ Illegible
- Notes on handwriting/formatting issues: Start and End Units accidentally written in 'time' boxes (and vice versa)

**PDF form (B_2009Summary.pdf) findings:**

- Page number: 16
- Start Unit field reads: 20808
- End Unit field reads: 20812
- Does it match first PDF? X Yes  □ No  □ Partially

**Individual unit cards (B_20090405.pdf) findings:**

- First unit card number: ________________ (page ______)
- Last unit card number: ________________ (page ______)
- Total pages with unit cards: ________________
- Estimated range if cards are sequential: ________________ to ________________

**Team B diary findings:**

```
**Team B English diary (B_Diary_En.docx):**

NOT FOUND - Diary covers 15-30 March 2009 only, ends before April 5.

**Team B Bulgarian diary (B_Diary_BG.doc):**

NOT FOUND - Last entry is 27.03.2009 г. (Day 23), diary does not extend to April.

**Adela April journal (Adela_JournalApr09.docx):**

NOT FOUND - Journal begins Saturday 11 April 2009, does not cover April 5 (Sunday).

**FINDING:** No team diary entries exist for April 5, 2009. The team diaries end in late 
March and personal journals begin on April 11. This 12-day gap (March 28 - April 10) may 
represent a break between survey sessions.

**NOTE:** April 5 is a Sunday. The investigation must rely on the PDF Daily Progress Forms 
and individual unit cards (B_20090405.pdf) to determine if survey work occurred and what 
units were covered.
```

### Conclusion

**Survey units found:**

- Start Unit: 20808  End Unit: 20812
- Source of units: X PDF form deciphered  □ Derived from unit cards  □ Diary

**OR, if no units:**

- Reason: □ No survey undertaken
         □ Non-unit survey work (specify): _________________________
         □ Form illegible/cannot decipher
         □ Sunday - possible day off
         □ Other: _________________________

**Confidence level:** X High  □ Medium  □ Low

**Additional notes:** 

```
Paper recorder accidentally entered 'Start Unit' and 'End Unit' into 'Start Time' and 'End Time' respectively (and wrote times in the unit boxes) - but the intent / meaning is clear, and we clearly have the units recorded (although there are five, not four as claimed in the 'total units' box).
