## Unmapped Names

Names that could not be mapped to canonical "First Last" format.
These require manual review or additional entries in name-mapping.csv.

| Name | Column | First Occurrence (Date) | Team |
|------|--------|-------------------------|------|
| Lizzy | Paper_Recorder | 2009-11-09 | B |
| Helvecia | Data_Editor | 2010-03-28 | A |

**Notes:**
- **Lizzy**: Czech volunteer, full name being researched. Known identity gap.
- **Helvecia**: Unknown Data_Editor entry not matching any walker for that day. Requires investigation.

## Verification Steps

1. Check that all Leader values are canonical names or empty
2. Verify no metadata entries remain in role columns
3. Verify no placeholder entries remain in role columns
4. Review the 2 UNMAPPED entries for manual resolution
