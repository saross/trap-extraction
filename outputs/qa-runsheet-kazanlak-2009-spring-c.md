- **CSV:** Leader: Elena Bozhinova, Units: 30035-30064, Walkers: 2 (Elena, Charlotte)
- **Note:** Comments mention "Unit 30010-surveyed intensively (Site Forms)" referring to earlier work
- **Status:** CONFIRMED

### 2009-03-20 (Friday) — Units 30080-30133 ⚠️
- **DPF (p.3):** Team C, Leader Elena, Walkers: Charlotte, Peter, Start Unit: 30080(?), End Unit: unclear (possibly 30033 or 30133)
- **CSV:** Leader: Elena Bozhinova, Units: 30080-30133, Walkers: 3 (Elena, Charlotte, Peter)
- **Source divergence:** DPF End Unit field is difficult to read - could be "300,033" (30033) or transcription of 30133
- **Gap analysis:** If End Unit is 30033, there's a gap of 47 units to Mar 23 start (30065)
- **Status:** NEEDS VERIFICATION (D001)

### 2009-03-23 (Monday) — Units 30012-30170 ⚠️ MAJOR ERROR
- **DPF (p.4):** TWO separate forms for this date:
  - Form 1 (Intensive): Leader CB/Elena, Units: 30065-30097, Total: 33, Author: CB
  - Form 2 (Mountain): Leader E, Units: 30012-30020, Total: 9 (mountain survey)
- **CSV:** Leader: Charlotte/Elena, Units: 30012-30170, Walkers: 3 (Charlotte, Elena, Meglena)
- **Source divergence:** CSV range 30012-30170 is INCORRECT. This appears to combine:
  - Mountain survey units (30012-30020) with intensive units (30065-30097)
  - AND overlaps into Mar 24-25 ranges (30098-30170)
- **Correct intensive range:** 30065-30097
- **Status:** UNIT ERROR (D002) - CSV range is completely wrong

### 2009-03-24 (Tuesday) — Units 30098-30131 ✓
- **DPF (p.4):** Team C, Leader Helena, Walkers: Helena, Peter, Maggie, Bryan, Units: 30098-30131, Total: 33, Author: Bryan Zlatos
- **CSV:** Leader: Elena Bozhinova, Units: 30098-30131, Walkers: 4 (Elena, Peter, Meglena, Bryan)
- **Status:** CONFIRMED

### 2009-03-25 (Wednesday) — Units 30132-30170 ⚠️ MISSING FROM CSV
- **DPF (p.4):** Team C, Leader Elena, Walkers: Elena, Peter, Maggie, Bryan, Units: 30132-30170, Total: 38, Author: Bryan Zlatos
- **CSV:** No units recorded, Note: "Non-standard survey: Systematic transect survey"
- **Source divergence:** DPF clearly shows intensive survey with units 30132-30170, but CSV incorrectly marks as non-standard
- **Status:** INCORRECT CATEGORISATION (D003) - should have units 30132-30170

### 2009-03-26 (Thursday) — Units 30021-30029 ✓
- **DPF (p.5):** Team C, Leader Elena/Peter, Walkers: Maggie, Bryan, Units: 30021-30029, Total: 8, Author: Bryan Zlatos
- **CSV:** Leader: Elena/Peter, Units: 30021-30029, Walkers: 4 (Elena, Peter, Meglena, Bryan)
- **Note:** These are mountain survey units (tumuli documentation), not intensive survey units. The numbering (30021-30029) is in a different sequence.
- **Status:** CONFIRMED (mountain survey)

### 2009-03-27 (Friday) — No Intensive Units ✓
- **DPF (p.5):** Team C, Leader Maggie, Walkers: Maggie, Peter, Bryan, No units, Samples: 34, 42, Author: Bryan Zlatos
- **Diary:** Burial mound necropolis documentation for site GCh-061 (9 mounds)
- **CSV:** No units recorded, Note: "Non-standard survey: Burial mound necropolis documentation"
- **Status:** CONFIRMED

## Corrections Required

### D001: Mar 20 Unit Range (SIX-DIGIT MOUNTAIN SURVEY)

**Record:** 2009-03-20, Team C
**Field:** Start_Unit, End_Unit
**Current CSV:** 30080-30133 (incorrect five-digit interpretation)
**Corrected:** 300030-300033 (six-digit mountain polygon numbers)
**Source evidence:** DPF (C_2009Summary.pdf, page 3) shows six-digit mountain polygon numbers: Start Unit: 300030, End Unit: 300033. This was mountain polygon work, not intensive survey.
**Reasoning:** The numbers on the DPF are six-digit "old format" mountain survey units (300xxx), not five-digit intensive survey units (30xxx). These six-digit numbers were supposed to be retroactively converted to five-digit format, but the mapping is unknown. Preserve the six-digit numbers until the official mapping is found.

**User Decision:**
- [X] Approve correction to 300030-300033 (preserve six-digit format)
- [ ] Modify: _______________

**Status:** Pending (six-digit number - see planning/follow-up-actions.md)

---

### D002: Mar 23 Unit Range (TWO CORRECTIONS REQUIRED)

**Record:** 2009-03-23, Team C
**Field:** Start_Unit, End_Unit
**Current CSV:** 30012-30170 (erroneous combination of mountain and intensive numbers)

**Correction A - Update existing record to intensive survey:**
- **Corrected:** 30065-30097
- **Source evidence:** DPF Form 1 (C_2009Summary.pdf, page 4): Leader: CB/Elena, Start Unit: 30065, End Unit: 30097, Total Units: 33, Author: CB

**Correction B - ADD NEW RECORD for mountain survey:**
- **New record:** 2009-03-23, Team C (Mountain Survey)
- **Units:** 300012-300020 (six-digit format, preserve as-is)
- **Source evidence:** DPF Form 2 (C_2009Summary.pdf, page 4): Leader: E, Start Unit: 300012, End Unit: 300020, Total: 9

**Reasoning:** The CSV erroneously combined mountain polygon start (300012 → misread as 30012) with Mar 25 end unit (30170). Mar 23 had TWO separate survey activities requiring TWO separate CSV lines:
1. Intensive survey: 30065-30097 (five-digit, normal)
2. Mountain survey: 300012-300020 (six-digit, pending mapping)

**User Decision:**
- [X] Approve correction A (update to 30065-30097)
- [X] Approve correction B (add new record for 300012-300020)
- [ ] Modify: _______________

**Status:** Pending

### D003: Mar 25 Missing Units

**Record:** 2009-03-25, Team C
**Field:** Start_Unit, End_Unit, QA_Notes
**Current:** No units recorded (marked as "Non-standard survey: Systematic transect survey")
**Corrected:** Start_Unit=30132, End_Unit=30170, remove non-standard flag
**Source evidence:** DPF (C_2009Summary.pdf, page 4, bottom-left form) clearly shows:
  - Date: 25 March 2009
  - Leader: Elena
  - Walkers: Helena, Peter, Maggie, Bryan
  - Start Unit: 30132
  - End Unit: 30170
  - Total Units: 35+
  - Author: Bryan Zlatos
**Reasoning:** This was a normal intensive survey day with units 30132-30170, incorrectly categorised in CSV as non-standard survey. The DPF clearly shows intensive survey units, not mountain polygons or mound documentation. The unit sequence confirms: Mar 24 ends at 30131, Mar 25 starts at 30132 (continuous).

**User Decision:**
- [X] Approve adding units 30132-30170
- [ ] Modify: _______________

**Status:** Pending

---

### D004: Mar 6 Missing Mountain Survey Record (ADD NEW RECORD)

**Record:** 2009-03-06, Team C (Mountain Survey) - NEW RECORD
**Field:** All fields (new record)
**Current CSV:** Only intensive survey record exists (30025-30034)
**New record to add:**
- **Date:** 2009-03-06
- **Team:** C
- **Start_Unit:** 300000
- **End_Unit:** 300002
- **Survey type:** Mountain polygons (six-digit format)
**Source evidence:** DPF (C_2009Summary.pdf, page 1) Comments section: "MOUNTAIN POLYGONS 300,000-002"
**Reasoning:** Mar 6 had both intensive survey (30025-30034, already in CSV) and mountain polygon work (300000-300002). The mountain work needs a separate CSV line.

**User Decision:**
- [X] Approve adding new record for 300000-300002
- [ ] Modify: _______________

**Status:** Pending (six-digit number - see planning/follow-up-actions.md)

---

### Note Corrections (Mar 8, 9) - MINOR

**Records:** 2009-03-08 and 2009-03-09, Team C
**Field:** QA_Notes
**Current:** "Team not working: No diary entry for this date"
**Corrected:** Update to indicate mound documentation work
**Source evidence:**
  - Mar 8: DPF (page 2) shows team working with GPS Points 3043-48; Diary confirms mound documentation (tumuli 3043-3048)
  - Mar 9: DPF (page 2) shows team working with GPS Points 3014-20; Diary confirms feature documentation (features 3015-3020)
**Reasoning:** The team WAS working on both days doing mound/feature documentation (non-intensive survey). The QA_Notes incorrectly state "Team not working" when the diary and DPF show otherwise.

**User Decision:**
- [X] Approve note corrections
- [ ] Modify: _______________

**Status:** Pending (minor - documentation only)

## Source Observations

### Source Divergences

| Date | Field | DPF Value | CSV Value | Resolution | Note |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|------|
| Mar 20 | End Unit | unclear | 30133 | Verify | DPF hard to read |
| Mar 23 | Start Unit | 30065 | 30012 | DPF correct | Major error in CSV |
| Mar 23 | End Unit | 30097 | 30170 | DPF correct | CSV extends into other dates |
| Mar 25 | Units | 30132-30170 | none | Add | Incorrectly marked non-standard |

### Unit Sequence Analysis (Intensive Survey Only)

| Date | DPF Range | CSV Range | Continuity |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Mar 04 | 30000-30024 | 30000-30024 | ✓ |
| Mar 06 | 30025-30034 | 30025-30034 | ✓ (follows Mar 04) |
| Mar 19 | 30035-30064 | 30035-30064 | ✓ (follows Mar 06) |
| Mar 20 | 30080-? | 30080-30133 | Gap 30065-30079 not covered? |
| Mar 23 | 30065-30097 | 30012-30170 | ⚠️ DPF fills gap 30065-30079 |
| Mar 24 | 30098-30131 | 30098-30131 | ✓ (follows Mar 23 DPF) |
| Mar 25 | 30132-30170 | none | ✓ (follows Mar 24) |

**Observation:** The DPF unit sequence is continuous (30000→30034→30035→30064→30065→30097→30098→30131→30132→30170), but CSV has errors that break this continuity. The Mar 20 gap (30065-30079) is actually covered by Mar 23 (which comes BEFORE Mar 20 in the unit sequence).

### Source Reliability Patterns

- **Mixed survey types:** Team C conducted both intensive and non-standard survey. Care needed to distinguish unit types (30xxx intensive vs 300xxx mountain polygons vs object numbers like 3024, 3043).
- **CSV categorisation errors:** Mar 25 was incorrectly marked as non-standard despite having intensive survey units.
- **Range aggregation error:** Mar 23 CSV appears to have aggregated multiple ranges incorrectly.

---

## Notes

- **Complex survey programme:** Team C conducted mound reconnaissance alongside intensive survey, resulting in many days without intensive survey units.
- **Multiple numbering systems:** Intensive units (30xxx), mountain polygons (300xxx), and object numbers (3xxx for tumuli/features) were used.
- **EN diary coverage:** English diary (C_Journal_En.docx) provides detailed narrative of mound documentation work, useful for understanding non-standard survey days.
- **Non-sequential dates:** The intensive survey unit sequence doesn't follow calendar order (e.g., Mar 23 units 30065-30097 fill a gap in the sequence before Mar 20).
