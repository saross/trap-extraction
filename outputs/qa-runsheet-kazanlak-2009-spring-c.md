## Survey Type Classification

Team C conducted a mix of **intensive survey** (unit-based) and **non-standard survey** (mound reconnaissance, object recording, mountain polygons). Many days had no intensive survey units.

| Type | Days | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Intensive survey | Mar 4, 6, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25 | Standard unit-based survey (30xxx numbers) |
| Mound reconnaissance | Mar 7, 8, 9, 11, 27 | Tumulus documentation (30xx object numbers) |
| Mountain polygons | Mar 12, 16, 26 | Extended transect methodology (300xxx numbers) |

- **DPF (p.3):** Team C, Leader Elena, Walkers: Elena, Charlotte, Baron(?), Units: 30035-30064, Total: 30, Author: Katarina (checked 23.3.09)
- **CSV:** Leader: Elena Bozhinova, Units: 30035-30064, Walkers: 2 (Elena, Charlotte)
- **Note:** Comments mention "Unit 30010-surveyed intensively (Site Forms)" referring to earlier work
- **Status:** CONFIRMED

### 2009-03-20 (Friday) — Units 30080-30133 ⚠️
- **DPF (p.3):** Team C, Leader Elena, Walkers: Charlotte, Peter, Start Unit: 30080(?), End Unit: unclear (possibly 30033 or 30133)
- **CSV:** Leader: Elena Bozhinova, Units: 30080-30133, Walkers: 3 (Elena, Charlotte, Peter)
- **Source divergence:** DPF End Unit field is difficult to read - could be "300,033" (30033) or transcription of 30133
- **Gap analysis:** If End Unit is 30033, there's a gap of 47 units to Mar 23 start (30065)
- **Status:** NEEDS VERIFICATION (D001)

### 2009-03-23 (Monday) — Units 30012-30170 ⚠️ MAJOR ERROR
- **DPF (p.4):** TWO separate forms for this date:
  - Form 1 (Intensive): Leader CB/Elena, Units: 30065-30097, Total: 33, Author: CB
  - Form 2 (Mountain): Leader E, Units: 30012-30020, Total: 9 (mountain survey)
- **CSV:** Leader: Charlotte/Elena, Units: 30012-30170, Walkers: 3 (Charlotte, Elena, Meglena)
- **Source divergence:** CSV range 30012-30170 is INCORRECT. This appears to combine:
  - Mountain survey units (30012-30020) with intensive units (30065-30097)
  - AND overlaps into Mar 24-25 ranges (30098-30170)
- **Correct intensive range:** 30065-30097
- **Status:** UNIT ERROR (D002) - CSV range is completely wrong

### 2009-03-24 (Tuesday) — Units 30098-30131 ✓
- **DPF (p.4):** Team C, Leader Helena, Walkers: Helena, Peter, Maggie, Bryan, Units: 30098-30131, Total: 33, Author: Bryan Zlatos
- **CSV:** Leader: Elena Bozhinova, Units: 30098-30131, Walkers: 4 (Elena, Peter, Meglena, Bryan)
- **Status:** CONFIRMED

### 2009-03-25 (Wednesday) — Units 30132-30170 ⚠️ MISSING FROM CSV
- **DPF (p.4):** Team C, Leader Elena, Walkers: Elena, Peter, Maggie, Bryan, Units: 30132-30170, Total: 38, Author: Bryan Zlatos
- **CSV:** No units recorded, Note: "Non-standard survey: Systematic transect survey"
- **Source divergence:** DPF clearly shows intensive survey with units 30132-30170, but CSV incorrectly marks as non-standard
- **Status:** INCORRECT CATEGORISATION (D003) - should have units 30132-30170

### 2009-03-26 (Thursday) — Units 30021-30029 ✓
- **DPF (p.5):** Team C, Leader Elena/Peter, Walkers: Maggie, Bryan, Units: 30021-30029, Total: 8, Author: Bryan Zlatos
- **CSV:** Leader: Elena/Peter, Units: 30021-30029, Walkers: 4 (Elena, Peter, Meglena, Bryan)
- **Note:** These are mountain survey units (tumuli documentation), not intensive survey units. The numbering (30021-30029) is in a different sequence.
- **Status:** CONFIRMED (mountain survey)

### 2009-03-27 (Friday) — No Intensive Units ✓
- **DPF (p.5):** Team C, Leader Maggie, Walkers: Maggie, Peter, Bryan, No units, Samples: 34, 42, Author: Bryan Zlatos
- **Diary:** Burial mound necropolis documentation for site GCh-061 (9 mounds)
- **CSV:** No units recorded, Note: "Non-standard survey: Burial mound necropolis documentation"
- **Status:** CONFIRMED

## Issues Summary

| ID | Date | Field | Issue | Action |
|----|------|-------|-------|--------|
| D001 | Mar 20 | End Unit | DPF unclear - could be 30033 or 30133 | [ ] Verify against original |
| D002 | Mar 23 | Unit Range | CSV: 30012-30170, DPF: 30065-30097 (intensive only) | [ ] Update to 30065-30097 |
| D003 | Mar 25 | Unit Range | CSV: no units, DPF: 30132-30170 | [ ] Add units 30132-30170 |

## Corrections Required

### D001: Mar 20 End Unit (NEEDS VERIFICATION)
- **Current:** End Unit = 30133
- **DPF shows:** End Unit field difficult to read (300,033 or similar)
- **Recommendation:** Verify against original DPF or other source
- [ ] User Decision Required

### D002: Mar 23 Unit Range (MAJOR ERROR)
- **Current:** Start Unit = 30012, End Unit = 30170
- **DPF shows:** Start Unit = 30065, End Unit = 30097 (intensive survey only)
- **Analysis:** CSV appears to have combined mountain survey units (30012-30020) with intensive units (30065-30097) AND extended into Mar 24-25 range
- **Recommendation:** Update to 30065-30097
- [ ] User Decision Required

### D003: Mar 25 Missing Units
- **Current:** No units recorded (marked as "Non-standard survey")
- **DPF shows:** Start Unit = 30132, End Unit = 30170, Total = 38 units
- **Analysis:** This was a normal intensive survey day, incorrectly categorised
- **Recommendation:** Add units 30132-30170, remove non-standard flag
- [ ] User Decision Required

### Note Corrections (Mar 8, 9)
- **Current notes:** "Team not working: No diary entry for this date"
- **Diary shows:** Team WAS working (mound documentation)
- **Recommendation:** Update QA_Notes to indicate mound documentation work
- [ ] User Decision Required

## Source Observations

### Source Divergences

| Date | Field | DPF Value | CSV Value | Resolution | Note |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|------|
| Mar 20 | End Unit | unclear | 30133 | Verify | DPF hard to read |
| Mar 23 | Start Unit | 30065 | 30012 | DPF correct | Major error in CSV |
| Mar 23 | End Unit | 30097 | 30170 | DPF correct | CSV extends into other dates |
| Mar 25 | Units | 30132-30170 | none | Add | Incorrectly marked non-standard |

### Unit Sequence Analysis (Intensive Survey Only)

| Date | DPF Range | CSV Range | Continuity |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Mar 04 | 30000-30024 | 30000-30024 | ✓ |
| Mar 06 | 30025-30034 | 30025-30034 | ✓ (follows Mar 04) |
| Mar 19 | 30035-30064 | 30035-30064 | ✓ (follows Mar 06) |
| Mar 20 | 30080-? | 30080-30133 | Gap 30065-30079 not covered? |
| Mar 23 | 30065-30097 | 30012-30170 | ⚠️ DPF fills gap 30065-30079 |
| Mar 24 | 30098-30131 | 30098-30131 | ✓ (follows Mar 23 DPF) |
| Mar 25 | 30132-30170 | none | ✓ (follows Mar 24) |

**Observation:** The DPF unit sequence is continuous (30000→30034→30035→30064→30065→30097→30098→30131→30132→30170), but CSV has errors that break this continuity. The Mar 20 gap (30065-30079) is actually covered by Mar 23 (which comes BEFORE Mar 20 in the unit sequence).

### Source Reliability Patterns

- **Mixed survey types:** Team C conducted both intensive and non-standard survey. Care needed to distinguish unit types (30xxx intensive vs 300xxx mountain polygons vs object numbers like 3024, 3043).
- **CSV categorisation errors:** Mar 25 was incorrectly marked as non-standard despite having intensive survey units.
- **Range aggregation error:** Mar 23 CSV appears to have aggregated multiple ranges incorrectly.

---

## Notes

- **Complex survey programme:** Team C conducted mound reconnaissance alongside intensive survey, resulting in many days without intensive survey units.
- **Multiple numbering systems:** Intensive units (30xxx), mountain polygons (300xxx), and object numbers (3xxx for tumuli/features) were used.
- **EN diary coverage:** English diary (C_Journal_En.docx) provides detailed narrative of mound documentation work, useful for understanding non-standard survey days.
- **Non-sequential dates:** The intensive survey unit sequence doesn't follow calendar order (e.g., Mar 23 units 30065-30097 fill a gap in the sequence before Mar 20).
