## Priority Rules

When extracting data, apply these priority rules:

1. **Source Version Terminology**:
   - **PRIMARY**: Preferred version (curated files, larger/more complete diaries, preferred translations)
   - **SECONDARY**: Alternative version of same document (uncurated scans, smaller diaries, alternative translations)
   - **SUPPLEMENTAL**: Personal/individual diaries providing additional perspective (not different versions)

2. **Names**: Prefer PRIMARY diaries for extraction; use larger diaries (BG or EN) as they typically contain more detail
3. **Data conflicts**: Tier 2 (diaries) > Tier 3 (scanned PDFs) > Tier 4 (individual forms) for walker accuracy
4. **Roles (PDA, GPS, Forms)**: Only available in Tier 2 diaries
5. **Dates/Units**: Tier 1 (Excel) is authoritative for survey unit numbers

---

## Expected but Missing Files

Based on the pattern that each season should have a SurveySummary and each team should have diaries and PDF scans:

### Tier 1 (Excel SurveySummary)

All seasons have SurveySummary files. ✓

### Tier 2 (Diaries) - Missing EN Versions

| Season | Team | Missing |
|--------|------|---------|
| KAZ 2009 | E | English diary (only BG exists) |
| KAZ 2011 | A | English diary (only BG exists) |
| KAZ 2011 | D | English diary (only BG exists) |

### Tier 3 (PDF Scans) - Missing

| Season | Team | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| ELH 2009 | A | No PDF scans found |
| ELH 2009 | B | No PDF scans found |
| ELH 2009 | C | No PDF scans found |
| KAZ 2011 | A | No PDF scans found |
| KAZ 2011 | D | No PDF scans found |

## Notes

- `.doc` files require `antiword` for extraction
- `.docx` files can be extracted via `unzip -p file.docx word/document.xml`
- Bulgarian text requires transliteration for the Walkers_Transliterated column
- PDF quality varies significantly; diary sources are more reliable
- `Diary March 09.doc` (Kazanlak 2009) is a general expedition diary covering 28 Feb - 19 March 2009, written in narrative style. Contains project-wide activities, training, and daily life but not structured team walker lists. Located in `Kazanluk/2009/` (unusual location - not in Project Records subfolder).
