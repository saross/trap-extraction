## Analysis

### Source of Errors

The missed narrative fragments all originated from the **Team A English diary (2009 Elhovo season)**. These appear to be truncated sentence fragments from diary entries that the parser incorrectly captured as walker names. The parser was likely picking up text near where names should have appeared but extracted the wrong content.

The single actual misread ("Bulgaria mi" → "[unclear]") was from a PDF summary form where the handwriting was unclear.

### Error Categories

1. **Parser extraction errors (14):** Narrative text fragments incorrectly identified as walker names
2. **OCR/handwriting misreads (1):** Unclear text misinterpreted during extraction

### Recommendations for Future Extraction

1. **Stricter name validation:** Implement pattern matching to reject entries that don't match expected name formats (e.g., require capitalised words, reject common English words)

2. **Length filtering:** Single-word entries or very short fragments should be flagged for review

3. **Context awareness:** Entries containing common verbs ("is", "had", "arrives") or prepositions should be rejected

4. **Source-specific parsers:** The Team A 2009 diary may need specialised handling due to its narrative style

---

## Conclusion

The automated extraction achieved **91.1% accuracy** on walker name data. The majority of errors (14/15) were narrative text fragments from a single source document (Team A 2009 English diary), suggesting that source-specific parser improvements could significantly improve accuracy for similar future extractions.
