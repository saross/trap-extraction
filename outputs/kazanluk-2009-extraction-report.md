# Kazanluk 2009 March Extraction Report

**Date:** 23 November 2025
**Phase:** Phase 3
**Issue:** Walker data from general project diary narrative
**Sources:** Diary March 09.doc (general project diary)

## Background

Phase 3 investigates two Kazanluk 2009 March records (2009-03-07 Team B, 2009-03-31 Team E)
where walker data was not previously extracted. Investigation revealed that individual team
diaries do not cover these early March dates - only the general project diary contains
information about this period.

## Investigation Results

### Survey Days: 1 record extracted

#### 2009-03-07, Team B (Adela's team)

**Walkers:** Adela | Martin | Magdalena | Bryan | Simon

**Evidence:** Narrative references from general diary:
- "the two Bulgarians on Adela´s team, Martin and Maggie"
- "Bryan kept losing his shoes in the mud"
- "Simon managed to stab himself with Adela´s sharp, new knife while cutting bread"
- "Adela´s team had lunch on top of one [mound]"

**Source:** Diary March 09.doc (general project diary)

**Note:** Individual Team B diary (B_Diary_En.docx) starts March 16 and does not cover March 7.
Walker names extracted from narrative description in general project diary.

### Records with No Available Data: 1 record

#### 2009-03-31, Team E

**Status:** No walker data available

**Reason:** All diary sources end before this date

**Investigation findings:**
- Team E diary (E Diary_BG.doc) covers only: 20, 23, 24, 25, 26 March
- General project diary (Diary March 09.doc) ends 19 March
- No individual or general diary source covers 31 March

**Conclusion:** Walker data cannot be extracted - no source material available

4. Narrative analysis to identify walker names from descriptive text

### Quality Assurance
- All extractions verified against diary text
- Evidence quotes preserved for each extraction
- Investigation documented for records with no available data
- Source coverage gaps identified and documented
